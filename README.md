# Ranked Choice Voting App for [Trinity Academy](https://trinityacademy.com/)

This is a "quick and dirty" single-page web application for tabulating ranked choice votes read from a CSV file.
I built it for a friend to do an interactive lesson on Ranked Choice voting for Trinity students.

The code is not the prettiest but anyone who is interested is welcome to fork and adapt it for their own use.
