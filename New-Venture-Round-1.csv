1 in 5 individuals in the United States have intellectual and developmental disabilities, and 80% of these individuals are unemployed. This community faces workplace discrimination and is often reduced to roles, if employed at all, that do not showcase their value and strengths. We’re focused on proving these individuals have contributions to make to society through providing this community with a work experience that highlights their unique abilities. These individuals have warm personalities that need to shine, and 321 Coffee allows them to put those personalities on display through interacting directly with customers. Our volunteers make and pour the coffee into cups and add cream and sugar, all while talking to the customer. We see the potential in special needs individuals, and we want everyone to see that too.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Our venture aims to address this issue in a unique way. We plan on blending the communities of college campuses with special needs individuals by having pop-up coffee shops run solely by special needs individuals. This gives the special needs community the confidence to continue developing their work and social skills through pouring and serving coffee to customers while maintaining their friendly and positive demeanor. Our special needs staff will be given important roles in 321 Coffee --such as greeting customers, taking orders, making and pouring coffee, and restocking inventory-- rather than being placed behind the scenes. Through running this organization on campus and in the Raleigh community, we will spread awareness about our cause and create local change that has the potential to grow much larger. If we provide the space for our special needs individuals to shine, then others will come to see and appreciate their unique abilities in the same way that our organization does!

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

For centuries, beverage craftsmen have relied on aging to smooth out harsh, undesirable tastes in alcohol. The process typically involves stashing away barrels of alcohol anywhere from one to twenty years. The method is archaic, space intensive, and results in lengthy lead times. It’s a ubiquitous problem, faced by alcohol manufacturers of all sizes and types.

Costs of barrel aging accrue over time. Based on prices of barrels and the evaporation rate of alcohol, this process results in profit losses of at least 5% per year of aging. This doesn’t factor in costs of time, rent, or lesser contributors. Aging is a large financial barrier to entry, especially for smaller companies with limited funding.

The only commonplace solution is to use wood chips instead of barrels to speed the process, often compromising quality. Several companies are working to create their own in-house processes to battle these issues. For the vast majority of businesses however, no solution exists.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

We’re bringing alcohol aging into the 21st century by leveraging modern day technology, integrating science into a process historically left to chance.

Our innovation is a hardware based device that alcohol producers use instead of a barrel to age their alcohol. At base level, we’re creating a chamber that accepts unaged alcohol from a production line, rapidly ages it according to the user’s parameters, and outputs aged alcohol that’s ready for consumption.

We’re coupling this hardware with a software overlay to control it, giving our product unparalleled ease of use. We plan on using machine learning to analyze data generated from sensors and chemical analysis to intelligently predict the results of each run.

Not only will this product enable users to age beverages according to their desired flavor profile, it also ages alcohol in days rather than years. We’re building our technology from the ground up to be the most simple, versatile, and cost effective solution available.

The aged alcohol production market is massive, accounting for approximately $65 billion per year in the United States alone. Not only is it a massive market, but it’s seen sustained growth (2%-5%/year), which is forecasted to continue according to market reports. 

Aeva plans to enter this space with a product that will target all three sides of the market: beer, wine, and liquor. Each of these markets has its respective pros and cons, but the technology will function across them all.

Our product is capable of aging any beverage, provided that the aging process of said beverage involves using wood, time, or both. Because of this, our target customer will be any alcohol production company that produces aged beverages. The value proposition of our product varies on a case-by-case basis, but in nearly every case, it’s functionally and financially advantageous over the do-nothing option or any competing solutions.





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

We took an all encompassing look into the alcohol industry. We conducted in person interviews with 15 producers and 3 distributors across the nation to learn their struggles. We also surveyed 50 bars and 300 consumers to learn about sales and consumer preferences.

These interviews confirmed that barrel aging presents a challenge for many producers. In addition, we learned that most consumers don’t know or care how their alcohol is produced and use value and taste to drive their purchases.





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

Terressentia and Lost Spirits are our main competitors. Terressentia functions as a fulfillment service where customers ship them alcohol to be aged. Lost Spirits consists of an inventor attempting to provide a hardware solution like our product. These competitors have little to no market share, face scalability issues, and can’t tailor their products to different customer needs. By integrating a software overlay and proprietary algorithms into an in-house product, we can avoid both pitfalls.

Revenue Model: What is the venture’s revenue model? How do you plan to sustain and grow your venture? (max 500 characters)

We plan to use a subscription model. While this results in a large upfront expense on our side, we prefer this model due to the low financial barrier for customers as well as the revenue potential once our initial hardware costs are recovered. Furthermore, once customers commit to using our product, it would make little financial sense to revert to other aging technologies. This will help us sustain revenue and the success of these customers will assist us in promoting and growing our business.





Prize Winnings: How would eGames prize winnings help your venture? What are your current funding needs? (max 500 characters)

Our team plans to invest all winnings back into the company for prototyping and legal costs. At this time, we’re beginning beta tests in local distilleries, requiring us to improve our current prototype and potentially build more units.

We’re seeking funding to execute our beta tests, advance our technology, and assist us with the legal fees involved in filing a patent. Funding from this competition will assist us in reaching a point where we are ready to reach out to customers and investors.





Additional Info: Do you have needs outside of funding? Mentorship, physical space, advisors, etc. (max 500 characters)

Access to chemical analysis tools like gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and an space for product testing would help elevate our prototyping and proof of concept. GC-MS will be used to quantitatively validate our process, however, lab usage fees are high and tool time is limited. In addition, mentors in the chemical engineering, organic chemistry, or alcohol production fields may also prove to be a valuable resource.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Institutions invest an incredible amount of resources into spaces. This is especially true of NC State where Talley Student Union and Hunt Library are the university's most prized architectural accomplishments. Hunt Library cost upwards of $115 million to build, and hundreds of thousands more each year to maintain. Despite this, the university has virtually no information about the space at any given time; no way for them to figure out which rooms are in use, quantify capacity, or analyze foot traffic patterns. Currently, D.H. Hill has gate counters at the entrance to track rudimentary statistics on usage. Individual rooms have motion detector light switches that turn off automatically. Doors use card access linked to university IDs. In another industry, factories have manual clock-in and clock-out systems to analyze monitor workers. These costly technologies act as temporary fixes for the underlying lack of intelligent and actionable analytics.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Atomo's mission is to provide institutions (the Atomo customer) with a way to collect, analyze, and effectively use data about their users' (employees, students, etc.) interactions within a space. We aim to provide an entire stack of technology, from hardware installation to software integrations. The hardware is in a visually unobtrusive package that can be upfit into existing spaces. Our solution to the problem of collecting data about building occupants is a technology called iBeacons. Atomo uses these sensors to locate smartphones. iBeacons use low power Bluetooth to determine the exact location of a smartphone. By using a network of iBeacons in a space connected to a database, we collect data that is used to power Atomo modules. These modules are groups of functionality that provide customers a way to assess what they need and implement a system with services such as heat mapping, predictive analytics, and user informatics.

Marshall Brain wants to install our system in his classrooms for attendance, and we are in discussions with the manager of the EI Garage to install our system as well. We discovered that our customers have tried to prototype their own versions of our product. This means they will be interested in our product in the future.





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

On an institutional level, firms exist like Thingsee that outfit IoT for institutions; however, they operate by dissecting and reconstructing spaces. Our advantage is that we are able upfit existing systems non-invasively. In the home automation market, companies like Insteon, Nest, Philips Hue, and Indigo represent the largest market hold. Our advantage is that these systems are extremely costly and require technical expertise, whereas Atomo is engineered to reduce those barriers of entry.

Our biggest upcoming expense is incorporation. We are incorporating with Merrill Mason at Smith Anderson Law Firm and the cost for that will be approximately $3,000. We also need money for prototyping hardware including iBeacons and development boards. Additionally, in the near future we will need money for hosting our web and mobile applications. We also have plans for product design and A/B testing of our products. To ensure high quality data we want to provide incentives to our users.





Additional Info: Do you have needs outside of funding? Mentorship, physical space, advisors, etc. (max 500 characters)

Our single largest need outside of funding is space to test our system. This space should provide a high traffic flow for rigorous sensor testing and data capture. We are currently working with the university to use buildings on campus to test our project. The university is a great platform for testing because of the diversity in the use case. Professors and the administration require a high degree of fidelity while students require a user experience focused product.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

The primary problem the venture is aiming to solve is the slow and inefficient process of finding help while shopping in big-box retail stores (an example of a specific application or use-case for the technology). 

Secondarily the venture's app will help brick-and-mortar retailers compete with online retailers like Amazon.

More generally the app could be used to locate, with very high fidelity, persons in indoor environments using existing Wifi networks and Wifi-enabled smartphones. 





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

We aim to solve this problem by leveraging a technology known as a localization algorithm. In lay terms the technology is software that keeps track of certain characteristics of wireless signals propagating in an indoor Wifi network. With knowledge of these certain signal characteristics the software can pin-point with very high precision the location of the devices transmitting these signals.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Pressure ulcers develop after periods of prolonged pressure to a bony area of the body, resulting in tissue death and chronic skin wounds. Over 2.5 million patients are affected by pressure ulcers every year in the U.S. Bariatric, geriatric, and diabetic patients are especially prone, but patients without these comorbidities are still capable of acquiring pressure ulcers. Many pressure ulcers develop during stays in a hospital, especially during surgical procedures. The most common, and most difficult to detect, area of pressure ulcer development is the sacrum. Hospitals typically provide additional padding, dressings, and pillows in order to redistribute pressure during or after surgery, but are beginning to pursue more technical devices with increased prevention abilities. Currently pressure ulcers are detected after external redness on the skin develops, which normally appears 12-24 hours after the initial deep tissue pressure injury. The time of detection must be improved. 





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Our device will combine preventative and diagnostic methods of reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers. Current diagnostic devices must be held on the skin by a nurse and measure the area once per day. Ours will improve this by constantly detecting pressure ulcers. In addition, our device will distribute pressure using air circulation to decrease the risk of tissue injury which leads to ulcers. The usage of full-body air mattresses has proven to distribute pressure more effectively than any other type of mattress, but we will adapt this technology into a shape specific to the sacrum. No other device continuously monitors pressure ulcer development, and no other device has combined prevention and detection into its design. We feel that by combining these promising prevention and detection methods with clear and continuous communication, our device will be much more effective at decreasing the incidence of pressure ulcers.

Market: What is your venture's market? How big is it? Is the market growing? (max 500 characters)

The estimated market size for pressure ulcer detection and prevention devices in general surgeries is $150 million. As geriatric and obese populations grow, this number is expected to increase in the upcoming years due to the larger number of surgeries and patients at risk for pressure ulcers at a rate of about 5.1% per year.





Customer: Who is your target customer? (max 500 characters)

The target customer is U.S. hospitals, especially for use in surgery units where pressure ulcers most commonly occur. Hospital acquired pressure ulcers (HAPU) are not reimbursable to the hospital by Medicaid or Medicare, so the hospital incurs an average of $46,000 in costs per HAPU. Therefore, hospitals have a large incentive to prevent and reduce the incidence of HAPU, including the purchase of detection and prevention devices.





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

This venture has interviewed and shadowed over 10 nurses, surgeons, and administrators at UNC Rex Hospital, including the pressure ulcer prevention staff. We have also observed general surgeries and analyzed the cycle of care for surgical patients, highlighting the specific shortcomings of existing products and identifying hospital needs. The hospital staff wants to detect pressure ulcer development as soon as possible and to increase the communication and accountability for this condition.





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

Foam, gel, and air padding are currently used in hospitals to prevent pressure ulcers. Diagnostic devices have not been adopted in U.S. hospitals due to poor usability, non-continuous measurements, and large cost. Our competitive advantage lies in combining a pressure-redistributing device with a continuous monitoring device. Nurses will only apply the device once, eliminating manual measurements and increasing the probability of detecting tissue damage as early as possible.

As geriatric and obese populations grow, this number is expected to increase in the upcoming years due to the larger number of surgeries and patients at risk for pressure ulcers at a rate of about 5.1% per year.





Customer: Who is your target customer? (max 500 characters)

The target customer is U.S. hospitals, especially for use in surgery units where pressure ulcers most commonly occur. Hospital acquired pressure ulcers (HAPU) are not reimbursable to the hospital by Medicaid or Medicare, so the hospital incurs an average of $46,000 in costs per HAPU. Therefore, hospitals have a large incentive to prevent and reduce the incidence of HAPU, including the purchase of detection and prevention devices.





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

This venture has interviewed and shadowed over 10 nurses, surgeons, and administrators at UNC Rex Hospital, including the pressure ulcer prevention staff. We have also observed general surgeries and analyzed the cycle of care for surgical patients, highlighting the specific shortcomings of existing products and identifying hospital needs. The hospital staff wants to detect pressure ulcer development as soon as possible and to increase the communication and accountability for this condition.





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

Foam, gel, and air padding are currently used in hospitals to prevent pressure ulcers. Diagnostic devices have not been adopted in U.S. hospitals due to poor usability, non-continuous measurements, and large cost. Our competitive advantage lies in combining a pressure-redistributing device with a continuous monitoring device. Nurses will only apply the device once, eliminating manual measurements and increasing the probability of detecting tissue damage as early as possible.

This venture will pursue a production and/or licensing revenue model. This model will allow us to create and sell our own products or allow companies with existing patient monitoring devices to incorporate this technology into their products.

Many artists, especially young freelancers, struggle to find a way to make their passion into a livable career and are forced to compromise in order to make this profession feasible. CASTLE seeks to provide the support and resources necessary to artists to create a sustainable career. 
Often artists struggle to find steady work, collecting payment from clients, or are simply inexperienced in business matters such as budgeting or marketing themselves. By uniting a diverse and talented group of creatives, we can collaborate for artistic advancement, share resources, connect members with clients, and host educational workshops so that artists have everything they need to succeed in this career.

By joining diverse artists across mediums, CASTLE hopes to provide unity between artists that may have not previously interacted. It is through this unity that will foster collaboration within the group, connecting artists with complimentary skill sets.

CASTLE will also provide assistance to artists by seeking out creative opportunities within the community and connecting those clients with artists. A group of people together have a wider knowledge of the field/opportunities than a freelance artist would have on their own.
CASTLE is also a champion of entrepreneurship, and seeks to help artists strengthen skills necessary to manage their own arts business. We will host educational workshops pertaining to relevant topics such as financial management or building an online presence.

Because CASTLE is a non-profit, funding streams will rely on donations and small grants from county arts agencies or foundations, however, we will not solely rely on external funding.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Electricity must be consumed immediately after production unless stored. Unfortunately, cost effective storage capacity does not exist, resulting in lost energy and revenue. In the first half of 2017, California wasted 300 gigawatt hours of electricity or $45 million worth of electricity. Similarly last year, China rejected about 17% of all on‐grid wind energy generated, equivalent $1.8 billion worth of electricity, and, in 2015, Germany about 5% or 9,700 gigawatt hours or $3.4 billion worth of electricity, all because of the lack of adequate storage capabilities.
Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind are intermittent. Peak energy generation and consumption do not match, which forces electric producers and suppliers to shut down wind turbines when there is excess energy being produced, or burn fossil fuel energy sources when renewable are not generating enough to meet demand.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

We have created a hydrogen electrolyzer capable of converting excess electricity into hydrogen gas.

We have developed a novel process to create an ultra‐efficient, atomically thin catalyst based on molybdenum disulfide (MOS2), synthesized from abundant and affordable elements. The unprecedented capability to synthesize such wafers facilitates the engineering of catalytic functionalities with controlled composition and structures at atomic‐scale precision, far exceeding the capabilities of materials created in bulk or with nanostructures. 

The new material will allow an efficient, low cost, low energy process to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen as an electrolyzer. The hydrogen can easily be stored and burned when there is demand for electricity. This solution, coupled with existing gigawatt‐scale renewable energy sources, will enable transforming otherwise wasted‐energy into hydrogen that can be stored and used on‐demand at lower costs than existing alternatives.

Chemists in the US spend approximately 27 million hours on laboratory tasks that are useful but repetitive. This is particularly true for chemists in our beachhead market of nanomaterials used in solar cells, LEDs and drug therapies. Chemists in this area spend more than 50% of their time on weighing powders precisely, dispensing tiny volumes of liquids, and waiting for machines to finish characterizing a sample. The result is that most nanomaterials take over ten years to develop and few technologies make it to market. While some automated systems exist to speed up research, they are often prohibitively expensive ($100k-$1M) or not sufficiently equipped for nanomaterials research. In nanomaterials and other types of chemistry (organic, biological), industrial and academic chemists are looking for cost effective solutions to accelerate their research.

At Chemios, our mission is to democratize and accelerate research through automation and invention. We are building a cloud chemistry laboratory, so chemists can do research from anywhere with an internet connection. To use the cloud laboratory, a chemist designs an experiment on our web application. Then, our cloud-connected reactors run the experiment automatically at a Chemios location, and the chemist receives results from the experiment via our web application in real time. By making automated equipment accessible online at a lower price, we reduce time-to-market for new chemistry products. Our first reactor eliminates the need for manually dispensing liquids and measuring reaction products by hand, and we can achieve similar results on other reactors by automating them in the future. It’s at the core of our mission to make chemistry research accessible to everyone.

A provisional patent was filed for the reactor in September 2017, and we plan to license the technology from NC State. In the future, we will add other reactors and automated equipment to the capabilities of the cloud laboratory. - How would you rate the venture's consideration of intellectual property?","Market and Customer



Market: What is your venture's market? How big is it? Is the market growing? (max 500 characters)

Our market is that of chemistry researchers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 95 thousand chemists and materials scientists in the US, and that number is expected to grow by 7% from 2016 to 2026. If our service is used by 0.4% of these researchers, we could expect $20 million per year in revenue. Chemios, however, has the potential to grow beyond that figure with broader penetration in the chemistry research market and increased value added to existing customers.





Customer: Who is your target customer? (max 500 characters)

Our target customer is a chemistry or materials science researcher in a university or corporation. We are starting by targeting researchers at academic institutions and those at startups, as they are particularly sensitive to the flexibility and cost reduction that the chemistry-as-a-service model provides. We have a letter of intent from a professor at Columbia University and are beginning trials by late March.





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

Our team has conducted 36 interviews to date with potential customers and partners in academia, startups, and large corporations. We visited San Francisco and talked with cloud laboratories there in the biotech space as well as major players in nanomaterials. One key insight was that the it costs a nanomaterials company $1,000 per day to synthesize nanomaterials because all of the experiments are done manually by a Ph.D. scientist and trained technician. 





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

Laboratory automation companies (e.g,. Unchained Laboratories, Syrris) provide automated chemistry systems that are expensive ($100k-$1M) and lack important features identified in our customer interviews (e.g., automated inline characterization capabilities). Automated systems at government laboratories are not under IP protection. In contrast, our pay-per use model is accessible; our reactor is perfectly targeted to start in nanomaterials; and our contract offers full IP protection for users.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

This venture addresses multiple problems.

First and most importantly, theres a big mismatch between the supply and demand for local art in Raleigh. Demand is very high (as demonstrated by the high rates of sales at events that feature it), but supply is relatively low because of the cost barriers that artists incur in order to display it. These cost barriers also force the artists to sell their work at a price that may be outside its actual range of value. 

Secondly, our target market is increasingly demanding that top quality, unique, locally sourced morning beverages be served to them with maximum convenience. Currently, many consumers forego high quality beverages for a low quality beverages solely because of convenience. 

Third, there is a significant lack of funding for arts education programs in K-12 schools around Raleigh.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

By offering free space to artists on our unit to advertise and sell their work, we can help to stimulate the underground arts economy while offering unique art to our target market at prices that are competitive. As the demand for the art we sell increases, we can scale our business online in order to meet it.

Secondly, by offering a relatively small menu of locally sourced signature beverages we can minimize our ingredient costs, optimize our supply chain and service procedures, and serve hundreds of drinks an hour while still meeting exceptionally high standards.

By donating ten cents from every beverage we sell to underfunded music education programs in the triangle, we can provide significant support to the arts education community.

Customer: Who is your target customer? (max 500 characters)

Our target customers span a wide demographic range but includes a relatively large proportion of individuals age 18-39. Generally, our target customer appreciates healthy and responsibly made products and is supportive of local art. 





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

Our customer discovery has come from a combined ten years of service industry experience between Brett and I. In the last three years I have conversed with thousands of individuals in our target market about their demand, preferences, and expectations for a wide range of beverages. As I continue to meet and talk with consumers downtown, I'm continuing to track trends in consumer demand that can be highly valuable if recognized.





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

Our venture is entering a mature market with many competitors. Location is the main determinant of direct competition, but it will inevitably includes major coffee chains and any nearby beverage retailers. Our advantage lies in the unique experience that you gain from visiting our venue and interacting with the art, and our exceptionally high level of beverage service and standards as compared to chains. Our mobile business model significantly reduces our risk of failure due to poor location.

Revenue Model: What is the venture’s revenue model? How do you plan to sustain and grow your venture? (max 500 characters)

We have 3 basic streams of revenue.
1) Beverage sales: This will account for the majority of our revenue.
2) Ad revenue: Companies frequently pay to advertise on coffee cups. We will take a small portion of this revenue and use most to sponsor a local artist to create those ads.
3) Art sales: We will take a small percentage cut from all art that our venture sells.

Due to extremely low start up costs, each new Corkboard business unit can be started in a new location for less than $30,000.





Prize Winnings: How would eGames prize winnings help your venture? What are your current funding needs? (max 500 characters)

This venture can be started largely on my own personal equity and credit. Estimates for first year star-up costs fall between $30,000-$35,000. All funding raised in the planning process will go to startup equipment costs and marketing. 





Additional Info: Do you have needs outside of funding? Mentorship, physical space, advisors, etc. (max 500 characters)

Some paid consulting may be valuable at some point in the planning process. We are constantly seeking and receiving expertise from individuals who have experience working with our type of business.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

According to a 2014 study conducted by Swiss lingerie company Triumph, a considerable 64.0% of women are wearing the wrong bra size. This can lead to breast tissue damage, back pain, and stretch marks. The current sizing method is not only outdated and inaccurate but also awkward and uncomfortable, which leaves the consumer with a frustrating and time-consuming shopping experience. Currently, retailers either employ a sizing specialist or they simply stock a variety of sizes and let their customers guess their way to the best fit. Many retailers, especially department stores, don’t have the time, expertise or manpower to give their customers an individualized and personal shopping experience. 92.8% of the women we surveyed expressed that comfort is the most important aspect of a good bra, and purchasing a comfortable bra cannot be achieved without getting the right size!





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

We are solving this problem by developing a sizing vest, that uses sensors to take accurate measurements that recommends the best fitting retail options. 
As a team of four women, we know all too well the challenges of finding a bra that fits well. Collectively, we’ve spent hours looking through the overwhelming selection of bras that most stores carry, only to leave a store empty handed, and thus the idea for Cup’t was born. In our market research we found this experience to be a universal problem among most women, a fact that came as no surprise to us. Cup't will redefine the shopping experience for consumers and therefore increase in-store sales. This will help stores who are competing with e-commerce and are in need of increasing traffic to their stores. Our company will also provide retailers with sizing data about their consumers to optimize their supply chain and let them carry a more accurate stock of sizes women are looking for.

Market: What is your venture's market? How big is it? Is the market growing? (max 500 characters)

We will first focus on the department store market before eventually expanding to the mass market stores like Target and Walmart. Each year the lingerie industry has an estimated total revenue of $8 billion. Of that, 39% is accounted for by bras. The industry is growing annually by approximately 2.9% with the majority of the growth coming from plus size bras.

 





Customer: Who is your target customer? (max 500 characters)

Our target customers are retailers. Cup't will provide retailers with specific customer sizing data, fitting technology, and the innovation that their customers are demanding. It will allow them to capitalize off of bras - one of the few products that women still prefer to come in-store to shop for. It will also help retail staff to allocate their time and complete tasks more efficiently while still providing excellent bra fitting services.





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

We have interviewed around 40 potential consumers about their current bra shopping experiences, and found that the majority expressed excitement about removing the awkwardness of being measured by a stranger. We talked to Linda, a sizing consultant at Macy's, who expressed how it would cut down on the time spent fitting women. Kelly, from R&D at Hanes, discussed how the methods being used currently incur a lot of expense for manufacturers as they do not have complete data on their customers.





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

Our most direct competition is the conventional tape measure. This method is simple, but often leads to inaccurate results. Cup’t, however, will provide more precise measurements. Zozo Suit is another existing competitor. It is an established business that only sells its sizing suit to consumers and specifically provides measurements for Zozo’s own clothing line. Our product, on the other hand, is a universal design that can be incorporated into any retail store that carries bras.

The problem we are solving is in many cities the parking situation is expensive and over crowded. If you take Hillsborough St. for example; during class hours, the street is filled with cars and students circling the block trying to find parking. This causes stress when people are trying to get to class and learn. As Raleigh continues to grow rapidly with new housing and development, the parking problems will only get worse.

Our solution is allowing homeowners and business owners to rent out their driveway or parking lot with a touch of a button. This would allow homeowners to make some extra cash and give business owners the opportunity for additional revenue that they wouldn’t normally have. This gives students and drivers the luxury of reserving and pre-paying their spot before ever leaving their dorm/apartment.

The problem we are solving is in many cities the parking situation is expensive and over crowded. If you take Hillsborough St. for example; during class hours, the street is filled with cars and students circling the block trying to find parking. This causes stress when people are trying to get to class and learn. As Raleigh continues to grow rapidly with new housing and development, the parking problems will only get worse.

Our revenue stream would be taking a percentage of all parking reservations and we would charge a small listing fee for home and business owners wanting to rent out space. The long term revenue model could consist of a subscription model, where frequent parking users could pay a flat fee each month opposed to an hourly rate each time they reserve a spot. Also allowing homeowners and business owners to pay a flat rate each month for unlimited listings.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

DetaTrax is looking to solve the market gap between targeted digital advertising and mass media advertising. Often, companies looking to advertise face a choice between highly targeted advertising such as mobile facebook ads, or mass media channels such as billboards that build brand awareness among massive disparate audiences. Both advertising strategies may be valuable to a firm, but pursuing both may be an expensive proposition. This problem for firms becomes a problem for the $8.4 billion billboard advertising industry because they must increase the value of their ad space for their clients. 
According to a 2018 report by IBISWorld, “Today, the high percentage of services conducted online has meant that companies are focusing more on reaching customers online and tailoring ads specifically to individuals based on data collection and analysis.” This trend means that data driven ad tailoring would add value to a billboard company’s ad space. 





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

DetaTrax allows for billboard advertising companies with digital billboards to be aware of the surrounding impressionable audience and to target relevant ads to those audiences. We use real time, location based data from established information brokers, and use that to find the billboard’s relevant advertisements for the surrounding audience. 
Targeting the advertisements of a mass media marketing channel greatly increases the value of impressions and the value of a billboard advertising agency’s ad space. For example, promoted Tweets, sponsored Instagram pictures, and even push notifications from applications such as Groupon are all successfully targeted using a real-time location-based data driven profiles. Bringing this targeting technology through our software to billboards with their massive number of impressions serves audiences more relevant advertisements, firms more effective campaigns, and billboard companies higher valued space.

The firms have not responded yet, but we are confident these businesses will see the value in our offering.We are also in the process of conducting a survey of advertising agencies to validate that they would find targeted billboard ads more valuable than current billboard ads.





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

Our largest competitor is complacency with current industry trends. The billboard advertising industry is currently shifting to digital billboards to increase the value of their space through more impressions and more clients per unit. This has allowed the industry to achieve steady growth. Combining this digitization of the medium with data powered targeting will further increase space value for them.

Revenue Model: What is the venture’s revenue model? How do you plan to sustain and grow your venture? (max 500 characters)

Our venture is a software as a service, so we will operate on yearly contracts with billboard advertising companies to provide our targeting system. This system will be priced yearly, per billboard. We can grow our venture through adding supported channels such as transit advertising, or by adding services such as supporting matching with digital web ads and converting them to billboard advertising.





Prize Winnings: How would eGames prize winnings help your venture? What are your current funding needs? (max 500 characters)

Prize winnings will afford our team the opportunity to build a prototype utilizing the latest tools and support from organizations such as IBM Built on Cloud, products and support from Axicom, and the costs of developing a large-scale platform that we will need. One of the biggest costs we will have is software development costs. We would prefer to give out as little equity as possible, but for the right development team or partnership, we are open to our options. 





Additional Info: Do you have needs outside of funding? Mentorship, physical space, advisors, etc. (max 500 characters)

While our main focus is to acquire support so that we may begin to fully develop, test, and iterate on our product, we also seek other forms of help. We would greatly appreciate mentorship, specifically in the corporate world from companies that could help us, such as the previously mentioned IBM and Axicom. Additionally, we would jump at the opportunity to have any resources that could be provided or afforded to us from any of these companies as well.

For those of us who aren’t morning people, waking up can be the hardest part of the day, and then actually getting up and out of bed after that can be even worse. Not to mention that a bad morning routine can really leave a lasting negative impact on the rest of your day. One would think that this problem has already been solved, but people are still suffering from the many pain points of their dreaded morning routine. And currently, there isn't a 100% foolproof alarm clock system that addresses every single pain point associated with getting up and out of bed in the morning at your desired time, every single time. This is what we are going to solve.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

To solve this problem, we created the Egg-Hunt: Wearable Alarm Clock, the first completely foolproof alarm clock system. Our revolutionary product is made up of four parts: a comfy, wearable alarm band, and three sensor beacons (or what we like to call “eggs”). At night, before you go to bed, you just place the alarm band on your wrist, choose your alarm time, and activate it, locking it to your wrist. Utilizing both audio and haptics, it will wake up its user, but it will still be locked to your wrist. The only way to get it to unlock and turn off is to walk around your house and scan the alarm band against the three sensor beacons (eggs) that you placed throughout your house. By the time you have scanned all three eggs, you will be alert, awake, and far away from your bed, ready to start your day.

I know from first-hand experience that many high schools do not adequately provide their students with real-work learning experiences. There is a knowledge gap between what students are taught in school and what businesses expect students to know. This becomes an issue when graduates begin to apply for entry-level jobs. This same problem arises when students have ideas to start ventures, but do not have the skills to push those ideas forward.

I have been heavily involved in the Albright Entrepreneur's Village for the past three years, working in various capacities on my own projects as well as helping my peers with their ventures. I have taken programming through the Entrepreneurship Initiative here at NC State as well as at the eClinic in HQ Raleigh. I understand what the best styles of teaching entrepreneurial skills are and how to show students strategies to solve complex problems.

I have a technical background in computer engineering although my current field of study is user testing. I am able to understand the technical side of launching educational services as well as developing products through design sprints and user experience testing. My unique mix of technical skills and ""soft"" entrepreneurial skills make me the most qualified to tackle the current issues in our educational system.

I have been mentored by the Albright Entrepreneur's Village staff (especially Haley and Macy) through my customer discovery and market research practices. They have also helped me develop proposals for my pilot program.

I have also had discussions with Lewis and Gabe from the NCSU eClinic, as the programming that they have developed is similar to what I want to provide for high school students. Their guidance has been invaluable in designing the curriculum for my pilot program.

I know from first-hand experience that many high schools do not adequately provide their students with real-work learning experiences. There is a knowledge gap between what students are taught in school and what businesses expect students to know. This becomes an issue when graduates begin to apply for entry-level jobs. This same problem arises when students have ideas to start ventures, but do not have the skills to push those ideas forward.

I have been heavily involved in the Albright Entrepreneur's Village for the past three years, working in various capacities on my own projects as well as helping my peers with their ventures. I have taken programming through the Entrepreneurship Initiative here at NC State as well as at the eClinic in HQ Raleigh. I understand what the best styles of teaching entrepreneurial skills are and how to show students strategies to solve complex problems.

I have a technical background in computer engineering although my current field of study is user testing. I am able to understand the technical side of launching educational services as well as developing products through design sprints and user experience testing. My unique mix of technical skills and ""soft"" entrepreneurial skills make me the most qualified to tackle the current issues in our educational system.





Mentors/Advisors: Do you have any mentors or advisors currently assisting with your company? In what areas are you currently receiving mentorship or advice? (max 500 characters)

I have been mentored by the Albright Entrepreneur's Village staff (especially Haley and Macy) through my customer discovery and market research practices. They have also helped me develop proposals for my pilot program.

I have also had discussions with Lewis and Gabe from the NCSU eClinic, as the programming that they have developed is similar to what I want to provide for high school students. Their guidance has been invaluable in designing the curriculum for my pilot program.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Students graduating from high school (or even college) are typically unprepared to enter the workforce at the entry-level or start their own businesses, which is a symptom of the talent gap that exists. There is not enough emphasis on developing ""soft"" skills throughout grade school that are necessary to function in the business world. The Committee for Economic Development put out a report in 2015 that stated ""24% of employers believed recent college grads are prepared to analyze and solve complex problems.."" and ""just 18% of employers believe that these grads are well-prepared to work with people from different backgrounds."" 

Programming to fix these issues is essential in the current educational ecosystem. Businesses are looking for skills that are not being taught in schools. Even colleges are beginning to look for extra-curricular ""soft"" skills that are currently absent from high school education in their admission applications.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

I wanted to build computers in high school and sell them for a profit. I had absolutely no idea how to do this though. It wasn't until I became involved with the Entrepreneur's Initiative here at NC State and learned these skills that I finally had to confidence to launch my first venture. By this time I had missed the ideal time period when many successful custom PC startups blew up and I barely broke even financially. Despite not being profitable, I still considered the venture a success because I learned so many important skills along the way. This is when my personal confidence in my own ideas skyrocketed because I knew exactly what to do the next time I had an idea that I wanted to run with.

having this experience has made me committed to helping others with their ventures and I want to bring this passion to providing a unique curriculum to aid the next generation of entrepreneurs reach their potential.

Intellectual Property: Does your venture have any intellectual property? Is that IP protected? Do you currently have any legal protections in place (trademark, patent, license, etc)? (max 500 characters)

I do not currently have any protected intellectual property, however closer to launch I will need to employ legal protections for trademarks and licensing. I will discuss with my mentors when the best time to employ legal assistance will be. I am still conducting market research and am currently in the early customer discovery phase, but I will be prepared when I need to protect my IP. - How would you rate the venture's consideration of intellectual property?","Market and Customer



Market: What is your venture's market? How big is it? Is the market growing? (max 500 characters)

The market I will initially be looking at is that for charter schools, as their curriculum offer the flexibility necessary for new coursework to be accepted. Per the IBISWorld databases, the annual revenue for charter schools across the United States is $32.1 billion. This statistic coupled with an annual growth rate of 7.2% provides a bright forecast for entering into the charter school market in the near future.





Customer: Who is your target customer? (max 500 characters)

I am targeting specific charter schools for the pre-launch pilot program of my curriculum. I have had meetings with Dr. Steve Smith, the director of the Central Virginia Governor's School for Science and Mathematics (CVGS), who thought that it had potential to work at CVGS if I provided him with an adequate curriculum and resources to work with.

I also have plans to expand to other schools with the right variables for this kind of programming to be successful (""loose curriculum"", etc.).





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

My meetings with Dr. Smith have been vital in helping assess the current ecosystem for new coursework in charter schools. While new programming must still be approved by a committee, CVGS offers curriculum that is flexible enough to allow something like Entrepreneurship 101 to work. He also agreed that if a pre-launch pilot program were to show successes in CVGS, many other charter schools would give it a chance.





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

There are several programs that are run outside of schools, such as District C here in Raleigh, that are looking to provide real-work experience to students. The biggest reason breaking into school systems is difficult is the strict curriculum many are forced to follow. My solution around this is to begin in charter schools where it is possible to add new coursework through progressive administrators. Displaying success here will provide a much stronger case for applying to public schools.

Our current target market is Jordan, and countries with similar economies and climates.

I seek to solve these problems by building a lifestyle brand that stands for hard work and encourages people to follow their dreams. I do this by designing garments that are influenced by the brands unique mantra, “Inspired by the Dream, Motivated by Opportunity”. Empowering designs with a clean and minimal style seek to attract a wide variety of customers while simultaneously sending a message. By building a brand that stands for something deeper than pop-culture and media but still incorporates a style that is appealing to the market, I believe the goal brand will be achieved.

First Generation Apparel generates revenue in two different ways. 1. Sales through an online website or 2. Direct sales from me the owner. The website has allowed me to make sales and reach a broader audience. I have been able to makes sales all across the country. Shirts are priced at $17 dollars plus a $3 flat rate shipping fee for online purchase. Unit cost of shirt is $9.30. This creates roughly a 45% profit margin per each unit.

Winning the eGames would provide a much needed additional capital to be invested into the brand. Additional capital would allow me to develop and produce new garments to represent the brand. More capital would also help fund marketing projects and content creation to further build awareness of the brand and it's unique mantra. It would also help me pay for current recurring expenses including Adobe Creation Cloud monthly fees and web domain fees.

Outside of funding, the chance to be able to network and build relationships with decision makers of brick and mortar apparel shops in the area would help with creating a organic following.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

In the US, 40% of our national food supply (~165 billion pounds) is wasted every year. This uneaten food makes up 21% of landfills and generates 11% of all methane emissions from landfills. In addition, food waste accounts for nearly 35% of U.S. agricultural water use, and significant amount of energy and labor. Clearly, food waste is a huge problem that consumes other crucial resources. So where does this waste come from?

About 60% of this food waste comes from the farm to retail process. More specifically, suppliers often have excess produce because of over-ordering, frozen trucks, imperfections, and buyers rejecting shipments. There is no efficient way for suppliers to communicate deals on this extra food to other potential buyers. Oftentimes, distributors/suppliers donate this food, use it as feed, or simply throw it out. Suppliers are constantly seeking ways to reduce waste and capitalize on otherwise lost revenue. 





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Freshspire is a network of food suppliers, restaurants, and other businesses to make food distribution more efficient and ultimately reduce food waste. Food suppliers can log into our platform and post deals on their excess foods. Buyers receive an email/text of the reduced-cost produce in their area and can request it through Freshspire. After choosing a delivery time and selecting the quantity/type of food, the distributor is notified and delivers the order. Freshspire manages all payments. With a few steps, produce distributors/suppliers can capitalize on food that would have otherwise been thrown out. We are unique in offering a technology platform that assists in selling current items and later provides useful sales data. We plan to add features to handle all transactions, inventory, and client management for food suppliers and restaurants. We are also considering a delivery component. At Freshspire, we aim to form business/technology solutions to solve social issues.

There are about 616,008 restaurants nationwide. Using our initial pricing model of just a platform selling ‘2nd produce,’ we have a total addressable market (TAM) of $330M.

We have raised funds which we are investing in customer acquisition, platform design, and web development. Currently, our engineering talent is in-house, but we have a more experienced developer joining in May, and will need to bring on one more. The eGames prize money would allow us to build and expand our platform quickly and add delivery sooner.





Additional Info: Do you have needs outside of funding? Mentorship, physical space, advisors, etc. (max 500 characters)

As we grow, we will require additional funding to hire new talent and support a larger platform. Physical work space would be useful for focus and implementation.

Revenue Model: What is the venture’s revenue model? How do you plan to sustain and grow your venture? (max 500 characters)

Freshspire charges subscription fees and a 5% commission on sales to both users. Suppliers (typically have $50,000 waste/year) will pay $500/month to have access to our platform and buyers. Market prices for buyers are usually marked up 15%. To take advantage of at-cost 2nd produce, restaurants will pay $20/month. To grow and sustain, we will add features to our platform (client/inventory management, etc.), and offer a delivery service, greatly increasing the value and use of our product.





Prize Winnings: How would eGames prize winnings help your venture? What are your current funding needs? (max 500 characters)

Freshspire will be taken full-time in May 2018, so we need capital to cover minimal self-sustenance, physical space, talent, and product development. We have raised funds which we are investing in customer acquisition, platform design, and web development. Currently, our engineering talent is in-house, but we have a more experienced developer joining in May, and will need to bring on one more. The eGames prize money would allow us to build and expand our platform quickly and add delivery sooner.





Additional Info: Do you have needs outside of funding? Mentorship, physical space, advisors, etc. (max 500 characters)

As we grow, we will require additional funding to hire new talent and support a larger platform. Physical work space would be useful for focus and implementation. Additionally, we’ve seen that a number of successful food-waste related startups have a prominent food retail expert on their board (exp. prior CEO of Whole Foods), so we are looking for an advisor or connection in such a position.

Many people we encountered in the interview process said that they do not keep their record players out because it takes up so much room. Gruuv will have a small and sleek design that will fix this problem. Some other companies are doing smaller designs for record players, such as RokBlok and Love, they they are not addressing the second problem that Gruuv solves. All record players use a diamond tipped needle to read the grooves. There is a very large amount of force that this needle put on the record and this damages records over time. When interviewing people, some mentioned that they do not play their records that much because they do not want to ruin them. Gruuv is currently the only company addressing this problem. 





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Gruuv will solve the problems by first making a sleek and modern design for the record players. The record player will be able to play both vertically and horizontally. This design will allow people to store turntables easier. The vertical record player has only been design by a couple companies in the past, but Gruuv will revolutionize it but adding a modern twist and allowing music lovers to also lay the record player down to play horizontally. To address the problem of wear and tear on a record player, Gruuv will use laser technology to read the grooves instead. This no-touch process will allow people to play records as much as they please without wearing down the record. Our company is able to solve these problems because we are a diverse group of mechanical, chemical and industrial engineers that are passionate about music.

We have talked to about 40 people of multiple age groups and interested and what we discovered is that this is a very niche market. People that are interested in vinyl 100% of the time said that they would be interested in a more modern and smaller record players. They also expressed a need for a record player that does not ruin records. 





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

Gruuv’s competition is companies such as Love and RokBlok. These are modern record players, but they are expensive and do not solve the problem of the diamond tipped needle. Even though these are our direct competitors, Gruuv has a distinct advantage that lies in the laser technology that we will use to read the record.

Currently the global market for turntables is estimated to be about $450 million. The market in the USA is around $100 million. Millennials make up around 33% of the market, and we aim to capture about 1% of that market in the first year. This will result in the manufacturing and selling of over 1,500 units in the first year alone. This market is growing by an average of 15% per year, and Gruuv’s market share will grow with the market.

Revenue Model: What is the venture’s revenue model? How do you plan to sustain and grow your venture? (max 500 characters)

Gruuv intends to make the record player smaller and cheaper over the next few years. We to start out as a luxury product for around $250 but aim to reduce the price in a couple years. Since Gruuv does not ruin records, a vinyl subscription service will be possible. People who buy a Gruuv turntable could sign up to get a couple vinyl records every month and then they would be sent back and new vinyls would be sent the next month.

The eGames prize money would go towards R and D and prototyping. We hope to have a few people working full time over the summer on perfecting the Gruuv turntable. The money would go towards paying the employees and getting the necessary supplies to build the turntable.

Advisors and physical space is a large need outside of money. Gruuv is looking for advisors and mentors to give advice on the technical side of things as well as the business side. We really think Gruuv will be very successful but we definitely need the help of others to do it. Since Gruuv currently lacks an office space, it would be very beneficial to have a space where we can always go to work together on the technical and business challenges that Gruuv will need to overcome.

I (Sophie) started this company as a gap year project before attending NCSU and have kept it open while in school. My team consists of 13 amazing Haitian artisans and two managers on the ground in Haiti who handle order fulfillment, warehousing, and lead the artisans in projects. I have also built a team of design school friends who I go to for advice and help with specific projects consistently -- web design, management, financial planning, etc. Since I started Haiti's Jewels before attending state, I am the only full-time team member and regularly go back to Haiti to lead design seminars, check in on quality control, and spend time doing team building and entrepreneurship workshops.





Mentors/Advisors: Do you have any mentors or advisors currently assisting with your company? In what areas are you currently receiving mentorship or advice? (max 500 characters)

I have two. My business partner, who lives in Haiti full-time and also works with a team of artisans (200+), knows the country so well, and helped me create a sustainable management system so that the business could run without me while I attended University. My other greatest mentor has been my learning experience at the school of design here at State. I've had genius professors who pushed me to expand my skills and learn new craft forms, peers who challenged my designs and encouraged me to step outside of my comfort zone, and an overall environment that propelled me to consider every single design as a part of a much larger ecosystem. Every time I go back to Haiti to work with the artisans, I go with an entirely new set of information gathered from my education and peers here at NCSU.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

As a company, we aim to address two huge problems in the nation of Haiti: adverse poverty and waste. The average annual income for working Haitians living in urban environments is less than $400/year and those living in rural areas can make less than $100/year. Of the 10.6 million people in the country, 6 million make less than $2.41/day putting them beneath the poverty line. Cost of living in Haiti is also not cheap - basic foods like rice and beans cost about the same per lb. as they do in the states. The problem is currently being addressed by NGO's who work to subsidize food and create outlets for free commodities in extremely poor areas. There is also a massive trash problem in Haiti that makes the beautiful landscape dirty and deters tourism, without government organized organized solutions, the people are left to their own means, which involves burning more than 90% of their waste. While recycling agencies have been started, there is still little incentive for people to recycle.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Our company is aiming to address both problems through the creation of hand-crafted jewelry using biodegradable and recycled materials. We make components of our jewelry with melted down recycled aluminum and recycled glass (providing jobs and incentive around recycling) and also use local organic leather, natural seeds, bamboo, and hand-hewn coconut which help stimulate the economy and create jobs in the production of sustainable artisan materials. 90% of our materials are sourced locally in Haiti - whereas most artisan coops import more than 50% of their craft materials. Also, most companies addressing poverty in Haiti pay minimum wage, which is $5 per day. We do not believe that is a living wage, so we’ve priced our jewelry so that the artisans can be making about $50 a day if they work a full 8 hours. We also allow our artisans to work from home and have hired mostly young mothers because having a flexible schedule allows for more time spent with their children.

Haiti's Jewels' designs (graphic and physical jewelry designs) are our intellectual property, but since this is a small start up, we haven't had the time or resources to have our designs patented.

Market: What is your venture's market? How big is it? Is the market growing? (max 500 characters)

Our current market is split between two groups: the first are aid organizations working in Haiti who buy our jewelry and resell it as fundraising material and the second are small to medium sized socially conscious boutiques (like Ten Thousand Villages but smaller scale). Right now, since the post-earthquake aid has slowed, local/international NGOs are a decreasing market, however socially conscious hand-craft boutiques are only increasing in demand, so I see that market growing in the future.

Our target consumer cares about how they spend their money and are interested in who made their product. They want to make sure the maker is being adequately compensated.

I directed my customer discovery towards socially conscious boutiques and on-trend local businesses that attract our target customer. I have reached out to/interviewed about 10 local stores in the South East. While most were very receptive and responded positively to the business model and products, when I asked about what it would take to attract their purchases, they said strong photographs of our merchandising display would help make the decision less risky.

The wonderful thing about working in social business is that the market is still very undersaturated. My closest competition are other Haitian companies selling hand-crafted jewelry using naturally sourced local and recycled materials (which are few and far between) and so far, these artisan collectives have only been allies! However, I do have the advantage of being one of the smallest and youngest companies in the market with a lot of room to grow post-graduation with a design degree.

The majority of our business (90-95%) comes from wholesale purchases. The artisan who makes the piece gets about 30-40% of our wholesale price which leaves plenty of profit margin left over to cover our administrative costs.

As a company, we really need to expand our sales reach and I need to bring in partners who have a better sense of marketing than I do.

Money can always be replaced, barring the creation of a time machine, time cannot be replaced. Take for example a wedding, a day where thousands are spent on food, venue, and attire where eventually the food runs out, the venue time is limited, and the bridal dress may not be worn again. The problem is that time cannot be replaced or extended limiting the memory to the time frame of a day. Thinking as a consumer, when money is spent and the product offers future return and value, it is more likely to be consumed. Of all the expenditures on a typical wedding day, what offers the most emotional and financial future return? With over 1200 searches per month for wedding videographers according to Wedding Wire, there are definitely people seeking to preserve a timeless memory. For a long time photography has been the medium used to frame important occasions throughout ones life. This medium requires your memories to fill in the empty spaces around that single frame.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Our venture, Hightower film, is able to fit the need to extend time and preserve memories through our cinematography. Firstly, our creative process is unique in that we have free consultations with the clients before the event to discuss the vision and story that they want to create and how we can make that a reality. Having a connection with the customer, including being available at a calls notice, is a priority that goes beyond business. In accordance, building an atmosphere of ease and positivity through our customer service will in turn enhance the experience for the customer. Secondly, our editing style is cinematic in nature and modern in its delivery, perfectly fitting the contemporary target audience we aim to reach. Finally, Hightower film adds storytelling elements to the work to create more than just a series of video cuts strung together but instead a collective story.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Our mission is to help people be better learners, and to do their homework more efficiently. This mission motivates us to take on a few different problems for students.

Right now, students have difficulty keeping track of their homework. This problem affects a wide ranging group of students, practically anyone in university either has a difficult time tracking, or has room for improvement in how they currently track homework.

Another problem university students struggle with is actually learning from homework assignments. Often times, students will come across a difficult homework problem in their assignment, and in the rush to finish the assignment, simply search for the answer online, or use an answer-sharing site. This is a problem, because it is not only unethical for students to plagiarize, but because students also fail to accurately grasp the material being presented.



Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

To solve the first problem, tracking homework, we've built a browser extension that automatically grabs information about homework assignments as users view them online in order to compile a single list of everything a student has due. What makes this solution unique is that it is capable of getting information from online learning systems without having agreements with each learning site. Because we piggyback on the user's existing browsing, we are able to both collect the data we need more efficiently, and with legal protection, considering that the data is being willingly shared with the user's browser already.

Our solution to the second problem is planned to provide contextual homework help to students. We aim to collect lecture notes from the student's own professor (considering many professors upload their slides online) and then provide the relevant notes from class to solve that problem. This is both more ethical and more relevant to the student than existing services.

Our competitive advantage is that we aim to provide information for students that is more relevant than any other site due to it being directly extracted from their own professor's materials.

Our target customer is students currently attending university that need assistance with homework. This applies to almost every undergraduate student at most US universities, and undoubtedly some abroad as well.





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

We interviewed approximately 34 students in Talley Student Union at NC State University. Approximately 94% indicated they would use a system to automatically track homework assignments, and 84% indicated they would use a system to provide contextual homework help. Approximately 50% indicated they would consider paying something to use homework tracking, and 70% indicated they would consider paying something for contextual homework help.





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

As far as we're aware, we don't have any direct competition offering the same services as we are, but there is indirect competition. Sites like Chegg offer subscription services to share answers for assignments, and we're also competing against tutors offering to teach students difficult concepts.

Our competitive advantage is that we aim to provide information for students that is more relevant than any other site due to it being directly extracted from their own professor's materials.

Revenue Model: What is the venture’s revenue model? How do you plan to sustain and grow your venture? (max 500 characters)

We have many potential revenue models available to us. Our research shows students are willing to pay monthly for contextual homework help, implying we could also charge them a flat-rate, or even a rate per-class, which could be much cheaper than existing offerings.

Simultaneously, Universities and departments have a vested interest in students behaving ethically, and would jump at the chance to displace services like Chegg. This suggests that colleges could be motivated to pay per-student.

Next, we'd use some of what remains to create a definitive brand in order to increase user adoption of our initial product, homework tracking. We also would like to pay for a premium membership with our analytics platform. The remaining capital would be stocked away, or used for research of our next product, the contextual homework help.





Additional Info: Do you have needs outside of funding? Mentorship, physical space, advisors, etc. (max 500 characters)

We're seeking more promotion of our initial product, as early user feedback has been extremely positive. As we grow our userbase we gain potential later customers for our premium offering (contextual homework help) when later released. In addition, a large userbase provides a useful testbed to research trends and to research willingness-to-pay metrics.

We could also appreciate a contact within the University to eventually encourage professor adoption to facilitate more accurate homework help.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

The average college student spends more than $665 on textbooks per year. For the 20.4 million students that are in college, that’s a $13.3 billion problem. The price of textbooks has risen and will probably still rise in the next few years. More and more students are choosing to not buy textbooks solely based on the price. This decision is hurting students as they do not have access to the material. The second part of the problem is that the students who do buy the textbooks have a hard time selling them at the end. Students often graduate with a lot of textbooks that they don’t need. This is ultimately because the complexity and the hassle people have to go through to find buyer and actually sell at a decent price. There are websites where students can post their textbooks but students don’t have time to go through that hassle. Student often uses rental material, but due to inefficient in shipping and overhead cost,the price of rental is still significant.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

To solve this problem, our venture is using an online platform that aims to change the way textbooks are bought and sold. On our platform, students create an account and drop off their textbooks with our venture. Using our database and targeted advertising, searching for a textbook on our platform will be efficient. We act as an intermediary to expedite transactions between buyers and sellers and eliminate the hassle students often go through.The advantage we hold is that we will be extremely local, staying only on the NCSU campus. Shipping books from one side of the country to the other, both when buying and selling, is inefficient, but with our locality, this won’t be an issue and we can have lower delivery costs. The end result of our advantage is that we can give students the option of buying and selling at comparable rates. This will improve the number of books exchanged throughout campus and lower the “lost” cost of buying a textbook.

These expenses will need to be covered until we start selling the majority of student’s books in August and September. We will also use the prize winnings to cover advertising expenses to promote our company. Our current expenses include website development and early advertising. We would like to hire two employees to develop our website using the prize winnings.





Additional Info: Do you have needs outside of funding? Mentorship, physical space, advisors, etc. (max 500 characters)

Our needs outside of funding would be mentorship, textbook storage space, and advisors. We welcome any and all advice to help our venture grow and expand. A mentorship program would help accelerate our company’s growth and help insert us into the market with a greater strategic approach. An advisor would help avoid some growing pains and improve our efficiency by not having to research every detail of the business. The storage space will be needed come April to house our inventory.

With our 4 years experience in holding a record company, we have been able to help the artists in the studio environment. We quickly figured out that these musicians do not know how to organize their live music performances: they have to deal with the rehearsals, the place where they play and for sure, their fans. In the live music process:
-They first need to find a spot where to play, and convincing bars and clubs is not an easy task.
-Also, musicians do not know how to manage their online image, or simply do not have the time.
-They need to increase their fan base in order to get money, popularity and then find some place to play live.
-Artists are not the best technology users and therefore they need a quick and easy-to-use tool. 

We are so targeting live music artist, either:
-Artists who want to play in front of a public but have no idea how to find venues to play
-artists playing in many bars but struggling to organize and promote all their venues

⁃gather all the lyrics and music sheets in one place so that musicians can easily rehearse their set list;
We already have a mobile app (3,000 downloads +) that helps music lovers to look at all the nearby concerts happening. Our API is scrapping the web to record all venues.

Market: What is your venture's market? How big is it? Is the market growing? (max 500 characters)

We are in the live music industry; our market is composed by all the amateurs and semi-professional artists that are playing live music and using a computer and/or a mobile device connected to internet. Our early adopters would be the artists seeking for an affordable tour management solution and who do not have a manager to help them. We are for the moment operating in the (Nice, FR) area containing 8,000 musicians. 
Market is in constant increase as music is the number one hobby for people.

To begin with, we are targeting the 8,000 artists in south of France (Nice / Cannes / Antibes area) and we will expand the targeted market when our revenues will be sustainable in that area.





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

We have hired a 20 years exp. professional artist. Thanks to his complete network we were able to better understand the needs of all these actors, and, more importantly, to understand their relations. Indeed, by understanding how the musicians spend their time organizing their concerts and how they interact with the scenes representatives, we are now ready to propose them the ultimate product to make their life easier. We are already in the market with 150 free artists accounts, they give fback.





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

Our direct competition would be if artists hire a costly tour manager, serving the major bands as they are actually organizing the publication of artists venues on catalogues.
An indirect competition to our product is when a musician's friend/relative is doing the work of publishing concerts dates and maintain fan community communication for free.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

A reliable, low risk, fix for heart disease is viewed as the “holy grail” by veterinarians in cardiac medicine due to its prevalence. At present, there are only two treatment options for MVR (the underlying cause for symptoms of heart disease). Palliative care or high risk open heart surgery. The surgical option has proven to be successful with a curative effects and a return to normal quality of life. The problem is, the surgery is highly technical procedure costing $55,000. Also, many patients experience serious complications including death. Only a small number of highly skilled surgeons in Japan, Singapore, and France can perform successful procedures. It is lengthy, requires specialized equipment and years of highly technical training and requires extensive travel difficult for sick animals. No technology has found a way to successfully engineer an implant to veterinary specifications, until Mitramag.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Our venture will be introduces a revolutionary leaky heart valve fix called MitraMag. Unlike palliative care, placement of MitraMag repairs the leaky valve, providing curative results to the patient. Unlike the current surgical option, MitraMag will be able to be performed by all of the 2500 veterinary cardiologists and surgeons in the US and Canada. This new low-risk procedure requires less intensive training and uses industry-standard imaging devices. This eliminates the need for open heart surgery reducing surgical time to 20 minutes with low risk of complications. MitraMag reduces petowner cost to less than 1/5 the current procedure. All of these factors make MitraMag surgical correction accessible to the 8 million households affected by this disease. MitraMag has defensible IP for the implant itself, and it is critical to the commercial success of the product to develop the insertion and closure tool that ensures less intensive training and rapid adoption.

You may never have heard of the Shamisen, but you will remember its unique sound and character. It’s an esteemed member of the cadre of instruments that are to Japan as those of bluegrass are to the US; but hundreds of years older. It may be a niche market, but it has an outsize impact on its players, the world and the environment compared to the instruments we are all familiar with. Our team is perfect to solve the two key problems/opportunities present with the bachi, which is the gingko leaf shaped instrument pick for the Shamisen and the root cause of its outsize impact on the environment and harmful effects on the joint health of its users with prolonged use on the users.

Our group of two includes a hobbyist player of the instrument, who is also an industrial design major, an amateur in the craft of producing instruments and peripherals for them using traditional methods, and is experienced in fabrication and modern technologies/forms of prototyping. 
Our second member has experience in low-volume manufacturing, robotics, computer science, programming, web development, DIY electronics, automation and the fundamentals of industrial engineering.

Both members have experience in rapid prototyping, computer aided design, and bootstrapping.

We have limited past experience in entrepreneurship but have competed in entrepreneurship competitions in the past and won the Smithsonian ePals Invention Challenge in the team category for our age group. The competitions we participated in usually focused on prototypes and technological developments and less on creating a business plan, so we have less experience in that area, but have bootstrapped manufacturing capacity and will apply innovative lower risk business models such as just in time manufacturing and others.





Mentors/Advisors: Do you have any mentors or advisors currently assisting with your company? In what areas are you currently receiving mentorship or advice? (max 500 characters)

We have had input and feedback from the two most well-known musicians in the international market for the instrument, which is more specifically the player base of the instrument outside of Japan. The first is Kevin Kmetz, who is the lead musician of the band God of Shamisen and a well known player of the instrument individually as well. The second is Kyle Abbott, who is the founder of the largest international Shamisen community site and English Language store in the market. Both regularly travel to Japan, the homeland of Shamisen, to compete with other masters of the instrument.

Curved handle for optimal ergonomics
The traditional way to hold the bachi it to stretch the pinky finger over the top of the pick. This puts a tremendous amount of stress on the muscles in the finger, and is even impossible for some of the elderly players. We did some thinking and found out that the curved handle would line all the fingers up in a row.

This feature solves the inherent problems of the age old design of the Bachi in material choice, and cost with an advanced and completely biodegradable composite plastic mixed with pure keratin for some of the natural properties inherent to the best bachi on the market made with bekkou, or tortoise shell, and with the full range of options available with extensive customization for important acoustic features like blade rigidity, and cosmetic and usability features.

Curved handle for optimal ergonomics
The traditional way to hold the bachi it to stretch the pinky finger over the top of the pick. This puts a tremendous amount of stress on the muscles in the finger, and is even impossible for some of the elderly players. We did some thinking and found out that the curved handle would line all the fingers up in a row.

We do not have IP as we have concluded that it would not benefit us to seek it, unless funds become plentiful enough that it is reasonable to divert them to something other than marketing, testing and production. This is do to the fact that certain countries, specifically the ones with the largest markets for the Shamisen, the Chinese instrument, the Sanxian, that is still in use and that the Shamisen was derived from, and the peripherals for both, with the primary focus on the bachi of course. - How would you rate the venture's consideration of intellectual property?","Market and Customer

Our market is the players of the shamisen both in Japan and internationally. The international market is smaller but is very widely-spread. The new and improved Shamisen pick allows a wider base of people to pick up the shamisen as part of their musical repertoire. Since our product is easier, and more comfortable, to use, as well as cheaper; it allows people with limited movement of their fingers and hands to be able to play this difficult to handle instrument.

The goal of this invention is to allow people with any sort of physical disability to be able to play shamisen. I have met a lot of shamisen players, and the majority of this group is made up of elderly people. These people oftentimes have severe cases of arthritis, and we are looking to solve that problem by redesigning the pick. In addition to redesigning the pick we will also be redesigning the material to be stronger, and out-compete high-end, premium, expensive and harmful tortoise shell.

There are three focal points we are seeking to build the platform around; the difficulty of investing into cryptocurrency, crowdfunding performance-driven collaborative machine learning/sentiment analysis research, and algorithmic testing for traders. 

Many people do not know very much about the various crypto available or how to trade them. Others may know how to trade but may simply not have the time to actively do so. 

The most important thing needed to develop machine learning and sentiment analysis is data. Once data is provided, tools are necessary to visualize and construct viable models. After success, normally, placing a high performing strategy in front of investors would mean hours upon hours of direct messages, emails, and in-person networking. 

Lastly, there are various individuals and groups around the globe who have developed a proprietary strategy, perhaps for crypto, forex or maybe even stocks, who again, lack time or ability to automate trades in crypto.

After creating an account on an exchange, all we need to get started is the API key which is generated on every exchange. Once sent to the platform, trades will be executed on the client’s behalf. 

Thanks to Nic, our platform is currently able to execute trades dictated by custom strategies and optimize itself, effectively adapting strategies. The platform has a flexible web crawler which can be directed towards social media and news sources to scrape critical information about the market. We currently lack code to provide machine learners with the tools they need to form teams and build models on the platform but the platform currently encourages algorithmic traders to test strategies that work in forex for crypto and publicly display performance.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Diabetes is a global epidemic that is rapidly increasing due to a growing geriatric population and changes in common dietary habits. The problem we are trying to solve is the issue diabetics face when ulcers form on their feet. These ulcers are a product of common complications associated with diabetes, such as vascular disease, peripheral neuropathy, and a lowered immunity to infection. These complications are accelerated by hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) which is exceedingly common in diabetics and can be quite difficult to manage.

Current treatments include debridement, wound care, arterial surgeries, lifestyle changes, and amputation.

The diabetics who are most affected by diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) are older, typically over the age of 40. This is mainly due to the complexity of diabetic progression as a function of age and the increasing difficulty to manage blood sugar as a patient gets older. 25% of all diabetics will experience an ulcer at some point in their life.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

There is an abundance of effective treatment options for diabetic foot ulceration. However, these treatments require early intervention in order to be successful, and diabetics often do not realize that they are developing an ulcer until the situation has escalated. Our solution is an at-home system for early detection that will inform the user of the development of an ulcer so that they can seek medical attention and avoid hospitalization, costly care-cycles, and amputation.

Our approach to solve this issue utilizes thermography, which is the practice of measuring the temperature across a surface. In our case, the surface is the sole of the foot. Recent studies have shown that by detection of a temperature increase of 2°C between two symmetrical points on both feet can predict the formation of an ulcer up to 5 weeks before clinical symptoms have presented. We also plan to explore other possible biosignals to improve accuracy of detection.

Market: What is your venture's market? How big is it? Is the market growing? (max 500 characters)

The market for devices specific to early detection of foot ulcers is fairly young - we estimate total revenue of all major players to be around $2 million dollars. It is important to note the astronomical cost of care of approximately $18B associated with diabetic foot ulceration in the US alone. There is an exponential increase in cost with time of detection. Early detection can result in medical cost of $3,000 to fix the ulcer while late stage detection can be upwards of $30,000.

We have been able to speak to multiple physicians about diabetic foot ulceration, and they alerted us to the issue of early detection. One physician we spoke to was a hospitalist who has seen many cases of late stage ulcers that have resulted in long hospital stays and/or amputation. He was enthusiastic about the idea of an early detection system that could prevent this. We are currently seeking opportunities to speak to diabetic patients through the physicians that we have made contact with.

My biggest goal with this business would be to alleviate the effect of defunding from the public arts education program. This effects every student that goes through public school, whether they know it or not. Arts education not only helps students express themselves, but it has also been proven to help in other areas such as reading and math. The size of this issue is nationwide and is becoming worse as the opinion for the need of arts education dwindles. Currently there are other ways that also address this issue such as art studio classes or materials from an art supply store.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

My venture solves this problem by giving parents an easy, affordable way to provide their child with an opportunity to create art outside of school. This product also addresses adults and other individuals who didn't have an opportunity in be involved with arts education and are new to the art world by providing a simple way to be creative. My company is unique in that each canvas is hand-drawn by an artist for an artist. We are also a local company, which helps the local economy.

Arts education not only helps students express themselves, but it has also been proven to help in other areas such as reading and math. The size of this issue is nationwide and is becoming worse as the opinion for the need of arts education dwindles. Currently there are other ways that also address this issue such as art studio classes or materials from an art supply store.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

My venture solves this problem by giving parents an easy, affordable way to provide their child with an opportunity to create art outside of school. This product also addresses adults and other individuals who didn't have an opportunity in be involved with arts education and are new to the art world by providing a simple way to be creative. My company is unique in that each canvas is hand-drawn by an artist for an artist. We are also a local company, which helps the local economy.

During the team’s first meeting, several members noticed the designated note taker struggled to both transcribe, and actively participate in the meeting. Additionally, the notetaker’s rapid typing, with the clicking sound of the keyboard, was distracting for all meeting attendees. This led the team to an important question: For a rapidly changing business world, why does the meeting space still relies on mundane manual note taking?

To validate this speculation, the team conducted interviews with potential customers, individuals who were often involved in business meetings. We found that 56% of those interviewed attempted to take notes during some of their meetings. Furthermore, 76% of those interviewed, agreed that they would value a type of note-taking device during their meetings. With these problems in mind, the team began to formulate ideas on one solution to solve all of these problems.

And also a diverse range of indirect competitors such as Google Home and Trint. Unlike its aforementioned competitors, Palmer is tailored directly toward businesses, rather than consumers. The main factors that will set us apart will be: providing readable transcripts, performing action items directly correlated to businesses, and providing analytics on meetings.









How would you rate the following related to the venture's market/customer? - Customer Discovery Process","Financial






Revenue Model: What is the venture’s revenue model? How do you plan to sustain and grow your venture? (max 500 characters)

Palmer plans to gain revenue through B2B sales. A one time purchase of the Palmer hardware unit(s) is required. For analytics and transcription services, companies can purchase a monthly software subscription. The sale price of the unit will be $100 while the monthly cost of the software would be $1000. Palmer will in-house manufacture custom chips that will cut costs and improve overall functionality. Lastly, data gathered from transcriptions will be used in R&D to improve Palmer’s software. 





Prize Winnings: How would eGames prize winnings help your venture? What are your current funding needs? (max 500 characters)

Palmer is going to be heavy on both the hardware and software side so our initial startup costs are going to be on the high side. As such, eGames prize winnings will help the team fund our initial MVP model on the hardware and software side and front some of the beginning efforts on the R&D as well.





Additional Info: Do you have needs outside of funding? Mentorship, physical space, advisors, etc. (max 500 characters)

No needs directly at this stage but team Palmer will be looking in the near future for an advisor in the SaaS space.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Currently, several moist wipes producers label their products as ""flushable"", while others are labeled strictly “non-flushable”. However, consumers do not often heed label warnings, and many moist wipes do not disintegrate readily when in contact with water, causing clogging issues in sewer systems. The cost of repairs from plumbing clogs associated with wipe products is approximately $200 for residential fixes. However, cities like London, New York, and Washington D.C. are spending upwards of $3.6 million a year to address the sewer line issues caused by wipe products. Washington D.C. recently has regulated the sale of products labeled as “flushable” while guidelines and standards can be developed, which has been highly contentious with municipal, industrial and governmental stakeholders.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

We have a technology that allows moist wipes to disintegrate much more readily than current market products, alleviating municipality concerns with wipe products. Our soy-based moist wipe is made out of renewable materials and wastes from food industry. The proposed technology provides an environmentally friendly, safer, and true flushable wipe for customers. From a producer's standpoint, manufacturing costs can be reduced by 25%, as a food-industry waste is used as raw material and less binding chemicals are needed. With recent attempts at regulation and growing product popularity, our technology provides a desirable alternative for manufacturers and related brands to continue producing moist wipe products that meet consumer demand and satisfaction, and industrial standards for labeling and sale.

The research process is tedious and grueling. Understanding published research papers is critical to future work in the field, yet they are often written to be so precise that few people can understand the entire work except for the authors themselves. When someone tries to delve into these complex terms they often find themselves faced with sparse search results and even more esoteric papers to read. In this way, the results of much research are often left out of reach to those seeking to learn from it. This is due to three key problems: the lack of tools to digest complex jargon and figures, the lack of centralized knowledge source of literature, and the slow dissemination of new knowledge. There do not exist current solutions to this problem that attack it at its core. Another major issue is the lack of public access to publicly funded research. PeerIntuit positions itself as solution to uniquely address each of these issues.

PeerIntuit seeks to fill a StackOverflow and Reddit-esque role in the academia community. There is currently no centralized platform to discuss cutting edge research in a constructive manner. PeerIntuit fills this role as a layer between the source paper and the user. Friendly annotations upvoted by the community rise to the top enriching the process of digesting complex concepts. The choice of displaying the insights on top of the pdf is deliberate. The pdf is served by the IP holders allowing for legal compliance. There are three key features that make PeerIntuit special. One, the crowd sourcing of obscure terms link to the original papers allowing readers to understand the context behind them. Second, readers’ notes and highlights are aggregated into an executive summary across users, distilling core ideas of a paper. Third, the expansive Q & A platform will expedite the process of knowledge discovery and enrich future research as unclear pieces of a paper are quickly elucidated.

PeerIntuit seeks to fill a StackOverflow and Reddit-esque role in the academia community. There is currently no centralized platform to discuss cutting edge research in a constructive manner. PeerIntuit fills this role as a layer between the source paper and the user. Friendly annotations upvoted by the community rise to the top enriching the process of digesting complex concepts. The choice of displaying the insights on top of the pdf is deliberate. The pdf is served by the IP holders allowing for legal compliance. There are three key features that make PeerIntuit special. One, the crowd sourcing of obscure terms link to the original papers allowing readers to understand the context behind them. Second, readers’ notes and highlights are aggregated into an executive summary across users, distilling core ideas of a paper. Third, the expansive Q & A platform will expedite the process of knowledge discovery and enrich future research as unclear pieces of a paper are quickly elucidated.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

The research process is tedious and grueling. Understanding published research papers is critical to future work in the field, yet they are often written to be so precise that few people can understand the entire work except for the authors themselves. When someone tries to delve into these complex terms they often find themselves faced with sparse search results and even more esoteric papers to read. In this way, the results of much research are often left out of reach to those seeking to learn from it. This is due to three key problems: the lack of tools to digest complex jargon and figures, the lack of centralized knowledge source of literature, and the slow dissemination of new knowledge. There do not exist current solutions to this problem that attack it at its core. Another major issue is the lack of public access to publicly funded research. PeerIntuit positions itself as solution to uniquely address each of these issues.

Data used for marketing has some issues, from the unethical ways it is sourced and collected, to small businesses missing out on applying “big data” to solve some of their “small problems”. Plus aims to solve both of these problems. First, our data is collected fairly, anonymously, and in a transparent manner. We only collect data from users that sign up and consent, we’re very direct about our intentions, their data is anonymized, we allow them to cryptographically verify the data that we say we distribute, and they are compensated fairly for allowing us to do so. 

Secondly, that data is analyzed to produce valuable analytics to which small businesses will have access. Our company is working towards developing a powerful analytics framework that small businesses will be able to leverage in order to gain insight into their industry and market.

Setup is simple: users download our app, create an account, then securely sign into their bank account. They don’t ever need to open the app again and can choose to have funds deposited into their bank or Venmo account. We receive transaction data every time the user makes a purchase, but the information is anonymized–just a dollar amount, merchant name, and a zip code–so, we augment our data with Google to form a better description of the transaction’s location. We offer an additional payment, $5, to users who give access to their email–again, with the promise of anonymization–so that we can find itemized receipts and pair those with each transaction. We end up with a highly granular and valuable record of purchases, and the user is fairly compensated.

We are in direct competition with large data brokers, such as Acxiom and DataLogix. Our competitive advantage comes in our data aggregation technique. Data brokers typically build relationships and agreements with vendors, and purchase their consumer data directly. Instead, Plus takes a different approach and purchases data directly from the “creator” (read: consumer).

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Electricity generated through coal and natural gas is an expensive and damaging energy source. The energy crisis is prevalent around the world, and the environment is receiving the brunt of it and facing devastating consequences. In big cities, this problem is even more noticeable with high demands for energy around the clock. Cities around the world depend heavily on nonrenewable sources of energy for everyday things like charging phones and using lights.While solar panels and wind turbines do offer another alternative, they only harness energy when the sun is out and the wind is blowing. Our venture aims to decrease the dependence on damaging nonrenewable sources of energy in large cities. We aim to offer a cheaper and alternative form of energy and one that can harness energy around the clock and meet the demands of a city.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Piezoelectricity has the potential to harness lost energy from everyday movement such as the walking and biking in large cities. Piezoelectric materials create an AC charge when pressure is applied to them. If these materials are incorporated in the flooring of areas with heavy foot traffic, the material would generate electricity to help power the building such as in an airport. Our venture helps solve the high energy demands from a city around the clock by decreasing the dependence on nonrenewable sources. Our solution is to store the energy in a battery bank and then use that to power lights, charging stations, etc in a building. This would ensure that if foot traffic decreases that there isn’t a sudden energy shortage in the building. Our aim would be to increase the efficiency of these tiles and perhaps one day include them in mats, carpeting, and flooring in consumer homes.

The most important lesson I have learned as an entrepreneur since starting Reborn Clothing Co. is to surround myself with teammates who know how to do what I can't. Just as I have a lot to give to the company, so do they – in different ways. I currently have seven official hires, some working on product development and production as independent contractors and a few interns looking for experience with a startup. I recently launched a Brand Ambassador program and have applicants so far from UNC Chapel-Hill and App State. Although we bring different assets to the table, we all share the same goals of slow fashion over fast fashion, sustainability and storytelling through fashion.

Clark Rinehart is the Community Manager of Loading Dock Raleigh, a coworking space in downtown Raleigh. Clark hired me as a Brand Ambassador for LDR, meaning that in exchange for working a few hours a week at the front desk, I receive free membership for Reborn Clothing Co. Joining the team at LDR has enabled me to hold meetings with clients and my team out of their office space and network on a daily basis with Raleigh business owners. I also am a member of the E Clinic this semester and through that, have brought on Carey Barnes, former CEO of Plan 365, Inc., as a marketing mentor. The support from NC State has been widespread, including professors from Poole College of Management and College of Textiles.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Some articles of clothing have too much nostalgic value to give or throw away, but before my startup, there wasn't a convenient solution to the abandoned clothing in the back of our clients' closets. The only choice has been to leave it there, throw it out or donate it. The average American tosses 82 pounds of textile waste each year, totaling 11 million tons. Another problem is that companies sometimes have clothing that's made unusable during the production process or that's no longer on-brand. Yet another issue that leads to textile waste is when stores have clothing that isn't selling and so, they ship it overseas or send it to the landfill.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

In each of our finished products, our clients recognize the familiarity of their grandma's sweater, their old college sweatshirt, a pair of jeans they've worn for over twenty years, or their newborn's first outfit. What makes us unique on an individual perspective is that instead of completely stripping the textile down and making an entirely new product, we are able to preserve the character of the original garment in our end product. Additionally, instead of a company starting completely over on a batch of apparel, we can provide them an alternative option by transforming the unusable clothing into something that can be used. For a prime example, NC State University Admissions had boxes on boxes of clothing that was no longer on brand. They gave this clothing to us, and we're making vintage teddy bears out of it. We offer a creative solution to textile waste in nearly every realm possible.

My company is in the fashion sector, which is very difficult from the start to obtain patents in. Our company patterns for our products are new patterns and owned by us as described in each contractor's agreement, but we're not inventing new products.

Market: What is your venture's market? How big is it? Is the market growing? (max 500 characters)

We sell products made from recycled material online and at pop-up shops across the Triangle. For our products made from our clients' garments, we made shipping more convenient by sending customers an empty package with a return label of their garments they want Reborn. By selling pencil and makeup brush cases, laptop sleeves, etc., we set ourselves up for a younger market, but, by adding nostalgic teddy bears, stuffed animals, dog toys, bowties and neckties, etc., we keep expanding our market.





Customer: Who is your target customer? (max 500 characters)

Our target customer has evolved since our infancy. While we started locally, now we are able to reach consumers across America thanks to shipping processes. Our target customer for products made from clients' garments are women age 30-50 with a mind for sustainability. These customers typically have children and parents, making their potential for ownership of clothing with nostalgic value much more likely. Our target customer for products made from recycled material is a female student.

Last semester leading up to the launch, we interviewed around thirty college students to make necessary modifications to a line of prototypes. We learned that college students were not going to be our long-term target customer because they weren't willing to pay as much as we knew our products were worth, what with the uniqueness of making them from our client's garments. We also learned that our customers care about convenience and easy-to-use products (zippers are easier than buttons, etc.).

Our current competitor for transforming nostalgic clothing are individuals on Etsy. The edge we have over them is a shorter turnaround time – while their turnaround time averages four-six weeks, we can stay at two weeks by hiring more contractors to pick up the work. Other sustainable fashion companies are competitors now that we're getting into making our products from textile waste, but we still have the advantage of preserving the original garment in our finished products.

Our revenue model is based on sales from products. We also receive revenue from participation in DIY events. The most recent change I made to grow the venture was to add shipping online. Now when a client buys a product online, they receive a package with a return label in the mail. They mail us their garments, we make the product in under two weeks, and they pay for the shipping back to them. We're increasing our prices and adding more expensive products (quilts, etc.) to increase revenue.

We are at the point where we need more financial investment in order to scale. We desperately need space as we continue to receive more and more clothing. We also need to purchase equipment to improve the efficiency and quality of our production process. We are shooting a commercial in a few months and doing an incredibly high amount of events in the community that we want to pay for. I also want to be able to pay everyone on my team and not just the design team and order merchandise.

I have more mentors now than I could have ever hoped for, but I always am willing to have more. I would like to bring on more members to the LLC who are invested in the company like me.

We need a physical space to work out of and are hoping that will mean a space in the coworking warehouse at Loading Dock Raleigh when we're financially able to make that move.

ReneSense will help solve the massive issue in America that is the quality of drinking water. In the United States, almost 25% of all water is not properly tested. The EPA tests water quality by sending someone out to test the municipal water systems at random intervals throughout the year, however they miss sudden spikes in contamination levels which can lead to huge impacts. In fact, many water systems are only being tested once a year or less. At this interval, there is no guarantee that the water in the system is safe for the ecosystem around it, much less for human consumption. Many researchers and universities also run studies to test the water quality around the United States. Most of these tests are conducted near areas where pollution is likely to occur, such as near factories or construction sites. The people testing this water also are required to visit the testing site themselves which can be very costly and time consuming.

Our product integrates Internet of Things, data analytics, and renewable energy technology to provide an “always on”, water testing solution. Current products require frequent maintenance, are outdated, or in many cases non-existent as discussed earlier. The motive behind Renesense’s preventative approach is one of simple economics. After cost analysis of the Flint, Michigan, water disaster, our team found that the government spent 600 times more money fixing the issue than it would cost to prevent it ahead of time. In total, the disaster cost the nation several billion dollars in damage. Three years later, the people of Flint still don’t have clean water. ReneSense aims to prevent tragedies such as Flint from happening in the future, by identifying water quality problems while they are small and fixable before they turn into billion-dollar disasters.

College students all over the US depend on their mobile devices everyday for school, work, social media, and communication. For many students it is the hub of their world, and being without their phones causes a significant handicap for day to day activities. With the average cost of new smartphones constantly rising ($567 in 2017), the need/desire desire to repair rather replace damaged phones is ever growing. Brick and mortar, and mail-in repair shops have been popping up all over the country, but repairs are often inconvenient and costly, limiting their viability. With the On-Demand Service market booming, consumers (especially younger ones), are continually favoring companies that ""come to them"". The lack of on-site repair solutions leaves a huge hole in the phone repair market that isn't being adequately addressed.

RepairU provides on-demand repairs, at location of the customers choice for college communities all over the US. We employ and train dedicated and driven students on all of the facets of cell phone repair, while also building their ability to market to college students, outfitting them with a ""Business In-a-Box"". Bypassing the hassle of in-store drop-off repairs, we are able to eliminate a majority of overhead and drive the consumer cost of repairs down significantly over our competition, retaining high profit margins. Our technicians work 7 days a week to schedule repairs into the busy schedule of the average college student. From sit-down to checkout, most of our repairs are completed within 30 minutes, mitigating down-time for the customer.

RepairU operates on a ""Fee-For Service"" model, charging customers a specific fee depending on the type or service they require. We keep inventory overhead low, through an agreement with a third party supplier that provides our technicians parts on consignment. We don't pay for them until we use them. Each location grows as they complete repairs on their campus, and RepairU as a whole grows with each new campus technician added.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

The leading cause of death among firefighters in the U.S are heart attacks. According to U.S. Fire Administration, 53.2% of all firefighter deaths between 2010-2015 were caused by heart attacks. That amounts to 295 firefighter deaths during this span, roughly one per week. The heart attacks often manifest as being simple aches and pains that are attributed to being part of the job but, in reality, the firefighter is going through the early stages of a heart attack. Currently most firefighters have only been solving this problem by putting an emphasis on health and exercise, but this method is not extremely effective. This is considered a proactive method to prevent heart attacks, our method is reactive to get help faster once a heart attack is occurring. This is a huge problem in the firefighting industry and they know it needs to be fixed but do not have a solution that works right now.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

PulseAware by Rhythcor is a system that provides physiological data and monitoring to the fire service. Sensors embedded into a comfortable, duty-ready undershirt monitor the user’s ECG and a removable electronics unit analyzes and processes the data. The system provides continuous heart monitoring and data to the fire departments so they can better understand the health of their firefighters and ensure their safety. Our system alerts firefighters of heart related issues so that they can act immediately. Every second that a victim is left untreated significantly reduces the chance of survival. Most other heart monitoring systems are not capable of being taken into a fire scene and would interfere with their work. We are making sure our product will not cause them any harm and will not get in their way on the job.

We are trying to solve the problem in precision agriculture and survey engineering of the lack of reliable, accurate, and available data. We can execute repeat surveys of a particular project site or farm field at nearly any time the data is requested, all while offering much higher resolution and accuracy data than manned airborne or satellite image equivalents. The usefulness of accurate, reliable, and readily available data allows project managers and farmers to make real time decisions with our actionable data.

Our team has come up with an industry leading battery exchanger and charging solution to offer continuous operation for even the largest areas. Others in the industry use induction charging to power a single battery that is on board the aircraft while we can swap in up to 4 batteries that all can be charged at the same time. This means that during changing weather conditions, an induction charging unit may have imagery with cloud cover as well as bright sun which makes post processing quite difficult as the pixel values between the contrasting lighting are very different. Our system allows for the best quality data to be achieved, all with autonomy and little to no effort on the customers behalf.

We can execute repeat surveys of a particular project site or farm field at nearly any time the data is requested, all while offering much higher resolution and accuracy data than manned airborne or satellite image equivalents. The usefulness of accurate, reliable, and readily available data allows project managers and farmers to make real time decisions with our actionable data.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Our team has come up with an industry leading battery exchanger and charging solution to offer continuous operation for even the largest areas. Others in the industry use induction charging to power a single battery that is on board the aircraft while we can swap in up to 4 batteries that all can be charged at the same time. This means that during changing weather conditions, an induction charging unit may have imagery with cloud cover as well as bright sun which makes post processing quite difficult as the pixel values between the contrasting lighting are very different. Our system allows for the best quality data to be achieved, all with autonomy and little to no effort on the customers behalf.

Market: What is your venture's market? How big is it? Is the market growing? (max 500 characters)

Our venture’s target markets are the precision agriculture and survey engineering fields. The need for precision data in both of these markets is growing quickly as the benefits of precision data are countless. In the agriculture realm, precision data can increase crop yields by more than 20% and reduce costs associated with over fertilization and over irrigation. In survey engineering, precision drone data can be used in lieu of a manned survey operation, which is time intensive.





Customer: Who is your target customer? (max 500 characters)

Our target customer is the large scale farmers, co-ops, and construction firms that need precision data delivered in easy to understand and usable format. The savings associated with using precision data are great to these customers and so adoption of the technology is on the forefront of their operations right now.





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

We have talked with industry leaders in the precision agriculture and survey engineering fields who emphasized the need for a scalable solution for drone data collection. They also emphasized the need for the system to be rigorous in safety precautions to prevent any potential hazards. We also spoke with a farmer who said our system looked simple and he would feel comfortable with us talking him through a repair, if needed, a plus sign considering many farmers repair their own equipment.





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

Our direct competition would be American Robotics, who have a similar system that uses induction charging instead of having readily available batteries to exchange into the drone. They have brought their product to market, but we believe our system will serve the needs of precision data collection better by offering continuous data collection, rather than intermittent data collection.

Revenue Model: What is the venture’s revenue model? How do you plan to sustain and grow your venture? (max 500 characters)

Our revenue model is built around leasing the systems to farmers, co-ops, and construction companies for a monthly, yearly, or price per project installments. This ensures that we maintain the highest safety standards with our equipment and there is no responsibility of the customer to service the equipment if they don’t want to.





Prize Winnings: How would eGames prize winnings help your venture? What are your current funding needs? (max 500 characters)

Currently our startup has no capital except what Corbin and Skyler can contribute from their paychecks from teaching and researching on campus. We received $5000 from our second place tie in the Land O’ Lakes drone competition, but most of that money had to go to recouping the costs leading up to the competition during fabrication and travel to the competition itself in Minnesota. The prize winnings would help us secure provisional patents as well as continue to make our prototype market ready.





Additional Info: Do you have needs outside of funding? Mentorship, physical space, advisors, etc. (max 500 characters)

We have a few mentors that are available sparingly because they also have their own ventures to work on, but having someone who could devote more time to mentorship and advice would be nice. Currently we utilize workshop space that we already have between the two of us at our homes to work on the system, so space is not a problem at this point, but as we expand, space will be needed for fabrication of additional systems and prototyping upgrades to our system.

We at Scuba Tea are the biggest consumers of bubble tea, we on average drink 4-5 per week. We usually travel 20 to 30min to get to a decent bubble tea shop. We noticed that bubble tea is made with a lot of powder and fructose and non-dairy creamers, none of which are good for your health. We also noticed that there are is lack of supply of bubble tea store in North Carolina to meet the demand. We believe there is a much greater potential that has not been tapped into yet in the current location and bubble consumers are still on the rise. On average we expect to sell 500 to 1000 drinks a day to meet the demand. 





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Initially, Scuba Tea was started to satisfy our needs to save money, time and our cravings so we decided to make our own tea that uses real ingredients like they should be and after 6 months of experimenting we came up with a few flavors for a healthier bubble tea that we enjoy daily. 

We wanted to share our passion for bubble tea and our drinks with the rest of the world once we realized that there was a need for it. We have a unique taste that you just won't find anywhere else. Our goal is to establish a quality brand for bubble tea and make sure consumers know what they are consuming. We have done our research and really motivated and want to take this to the next level.

Like many people say, ""Big things start small"", this is exactly what we intend to do. We are intended to partner with clubs, have a cart around campus, and sell at Football and Basketball games. On campus, we plan on selling bubble tea once to twice a week for only a few hours(3hours to 4hours). Why? We plan on supplying bubble tea just below the demand to keep the interest afloat and allowing us to increase our business review to put the money back into the business.





Previous Funding: What funding has your venture previously received? Include all funding sources, venture capital or grants.

We have not received any funding at the time as its a fairly new idea but its self-funded by the founder the last 6months for the tea supplies.





Prize Winnings: How would eGames prize winnings help your company? What are your current funding needs? (max 1,000 characters)

Winning the eGames prize would help us kickstart our Scuba Startup by building our custom cart that looks unique and aesthetic. Most of the funding will be directed to buying supplies for Scuba Tea we would be able to buy logo, tea supplies like cups, tea, cooler, and drink shakers. It would enable us to effectively provide quality and order a bulk order to keep the prices low. 

In addition, would help us register as a business and file the necessary paperwork and secure our domain. With the help of eGames, we want to make our dream a reality.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Last year, NFL Television viewership ratings were down 9.7% continuing a slide from the previous year. It’s not just the NFL either. The NBA, NHL, NCAA, The Olympics and MLS are all experiencing sporadic or declining viewership. Of those who are watching less sports, 19% say it’s because the quality of the game and/or broadcast has declined. Regardless, the North America sports industry is expected to generate approximately $73.5 billion by 2019 thanks largely to revenue from media rights deals and merchandise sales. Pioneering a more innovative/immersive on-the-field/court broadcasting product will be the key for leagues looking to secure more media rights deals going forward. The ripple effect of declining viewership is large affecting nearly every aspect of the business from merchandise sales, ticket sales, sponsorships, player interest, ad spend, and media rights deals. It’s estimated that the cost of losing viewers at the current rate is $500 million per year (total). 





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Sportalytics boosts the sports TV viewing experience by allowing consumers to feel closer to the game than ever before. Utilizing state-of-the art, metric tracking athletic wear, Sportalytics allows for the real-time reporting of player performance on the field to the screen via the IBM computing cloud. Flexible microelectronics woven into the fabric of jerseys, undershirts, bands, socks, and athletic equipment wirelessly analyze, compute, and report kinetic data such as force, velocity, acceleration, positioning, and location to a machine learning engine to be transformed into on-screen data visualizations and comparisons. Sportalytics insights can be leveraged by teams and coaches to iterate better performance to give themselves a leg up over the competition. This all results in higher viewership, more fans, and ultimately a better product for sports leagues which can then be used to increase ad revenues and media contracts.

No. A product has not been developed at this time. In the future, we’d seek protection on the player performance gear as well as the machine learning and data reporting algorithm.

Market: What is your venture's market? How big is it? Is the market growing? (max 500 characters)

Worldwide, sports TV contracts account for $22 Billion. “North American sports media rights — fees paid to air sporting events on TV, the internet, and mobile devices — are projected to reach $23 billion in 2021, up from $19 billion in 2017, marking a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.3%, according toPwC.” Convincing media companies that the product on the field is worthy of broadcasting will be the central element to securing these contracts for league offices. 





Customer: Who is your target customer? (max 500 characters)

In a broad sense, the target customer is sports leagues like the NFL, NCAA, NBA/WNBA, FIFA, MLS, NHL, and The Olympics. More specifically, Sportalytics would target CIOs as well as Media/Digital Strategists in the Business Development department of the leagues. Leagues are looking for ways to differentiate themselves, boost viewership, and secure more media contracts; all of which are at the center of the Sportalytics value proposition. The second customer is the clubs themselves.





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

Customer discovery has been limited at this time. After speaking with a college football coach who said “This information would be very helpful in the film room” and seeing market validation from AWS Next Gen Stats late in the NFL season, the product concept became more refined. The same coach and many end user (consumers of sports TV) agreed that insights like this would “certainly make the viewing experience more pleasurable and exciting.” Research was conducted through informal interviews. 





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

The main competition is the AWS powered Next Gen Stats Machine Learning engine which gleans player position, speed, and acceleration data. Currently, Next Gen Stats does not display any data on-screen. They have visualizations, but are not truly in real time. Sportalytics offers a competitive advantage because the wearable technology gives a more robust dataset. Where AWS tracks data from a single RFID chip, Sportalytics synthesizes 100s of biomechanical insights rendering more than basic data.

Sudsy solves the inconvenience and hassle caused when traveling with liquid toiletries. When traveling, only 3.4oz bottles of liquid are permitted. Transferring fluids into smaller bottles can be time consuming, & still about 86% of individuals have liquid toiletries leak in his or her bag during travel, making the travel-size bottles unreliable. Carrying liquid soaps in several small containers also takes up extra space and weight, which prevents the traveler from having additional space for other belongings. Approximately 1.44M passengers travel by in the US alone daily (IBISWorld), and of these about every 1 out of 4 people have had a liquid product confiscated through TSA pre-check. TSA fluid restrictions are only getting more stringent, yet no change has been made to make traveling with liquid toiletries more convenient.The only way this issue is being addressed currently is through “spill-proof” containers. But, there hasn’t been an approach like the one I’m about to introduce…

Like an Alka-Seltzer tablet, it rapidly disintegrates in a palm-full of water, and turns into liquid soap. The user can then begin their regular cleansing routine. What makes us so unique is that we will be the first leak-proof, TSA compliant, “liquid” toiletry. We have an MVP line of shampoo, conditioner, face wash, body wash, hand wash, and toothpaste. Once our formula is finalized, we plan to license out the base formula to larger soap companies so users now no longer even have to alter their typical cleansing routine. Most travelers will go to the travel section in superstores, and pick up travel sized bottles, or transfer products in TSA compliant containers. Our product provides overall greater portability and convenience when traveling by air, as fluid restrictions will no longer be a question. Saving space, weight, and the ability to pack accordingly are just an added bonus.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Sudsy solves the inconvenience and hassle caused when traveling with liquid toiletries. When traveling, only 3.4oz bottles of liquid are permitted. Transferring fluids into smaller bottles can be time consuming, & still about 86% of individuals have liquid toiletries leak in his or her bag during travel, making the travel-size bottles unreliable. Carrying liquid soaps in several small containers also takes up extra space and weight, which prevents the traveler from having additional space for other belongings. Approximately 1.44M passengers travel by in the US alone daily (IBISWorld), and of these about every 1 out of 4 people have had a liquid product confiscated through TSA pre-check. TSA fluid restrictions are only getting more stringent, yet no change has been made to make traveling with liquid toiletries more convenient.The only way this issue is being addressed currently is through “spill-proof” containers. But, there hasn’t been an approach like the one I’m about to introduce…

The travel market for domestic flights + international flights taken by US residents in 2017 was 844.9M, and will be 872.29 in 2018 (3.24% growth annually) (IBISWorld). Of the 872.29M residents flying in 2018, 70% avoid bringing liquid toiletries on the go. Of that, 86% have had leakage. Making our target market 525.11M in 2018. In addition, the hygiene market is recession proof.





Customer: Who is your target customer? (max 500 characters)

Our target customer is air travelers who want to save space, weight, and avoid any potential leakage in their luggage. For consumers who are traveling for an extended amount of time, 3.4oz bottles crammed into a quart-sized plastic bag would not suffice. Sudsy is a concentrated product, so more product would fit in a fraction of the space.

Sudsy has talked to several retailers in the area, and to their customers as well. Great Outdoor Provisions and a store in RDU have agreed to keep our product line on their shelves once it’s ready for market and the IP is protected.

Initially, Sudsy tablets will be sold off our website and on Amazon. The travel toiletries market has greatly inflated margins compared to the rest of the industry. Consumers are willing to pay a premium price for convenience. 3 local boutiques have told us they will give us shelf space when it’s ready for market. We plan to expand by licensing our base formula. By licensing the improved dissolving technology to the large consumer packaged goods companies, we’ll achieve faster market penetration





Prize Winnings: How would eGames prize winnings help your venture? What are your current funding needs? (max 500 characters)

The prize winnings would go towards the filing of a provisional patent (2.5K), hiring a freelance chemist (~$250/hr) up to ~10K in expense, and then filing for a utility patent once the base formula is finalized ($12K). Additional costs would consist of marketing expenses, package costs, labeling, brand design (initially free via internship at Paradigm).
Initial Production run of 1,000 units: $4,500





Additional Info: Do you have needs outside of funding? Mentorship, physical space, advisors, etc. (max 500 characters)

If possible, I would love to find a mentor who has backend knowledge on developing a chemically related, consumer good product. The technology for making dry soap exists and needs to be adopted to the travel market.

A minimum of 3,000 people die each year trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea for a total of 15,524 known deaths since 2014 (United Nations). In 2015, Nepal suffered from a magnitude 7.8 earthquake, followed by an 8.2 magnitude earthquake a few days later, killing ~ 8,700 people in total (mercycorps.org). Tragically, cloud-cover prevented satellites from providing ground images to help assess the most damaged areas post-earthquakes. NGO’s currently provide significant first-aid relief to natural disasters and refugee crises and currently use drones. However, most Search And Rescue (SAR) drone systems currently in operation require a pilot per drone and have significant flight-time and ground-cover limitations due to being on multi-rotor platforms. Additionally, SAR drones are typically expensive, costly to repair, and difficult to master over a sea or ocean.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Take2 Labs solves this problem by providing a fully autonomous and scalable SAR platform that will double flight-time and quadruple area coverage per drone, and be completely controllable by one person. This will be accomplished by switching to an autonomous plane based platform for the flight system. The autonomous planes will either take incremental pictures for damage assessment, or in real-time scan the areas beneath it using neural networks to detect people. If a person is located, a message will be sent to the ground control station (GCS) with the image and GPS coordinates. Additionally, by switching to a plane, reusability and reparability are increased while per item price is decreased. Furthermore, our team will make our product modular, allowing for varied missions, as well as the ability to add new capabilities in the future compatible with previous versions.

Market: What is your venture's market? How big is it? Is the market growing? (max 500 characters)

Our current market is humanitarian aid. Unfortunately, humanitarian aid is wildly varying and can from one day to the next dramatically increase, or decrease. Markets include refugee SAR in the Mediterranean, refugee population estimates for aid dispersal, and post-natural disaster damage assessment. This market is unpredictable due to the natural forces at play (volcanoes, earthquakes), but vital to save thousands of lives every single year.

Market: What is your venture's market? How big is it? Is the market growing? (max 500 characters)

Our current market is humanitarian aid. Unfortunately, humanitarian aid is wildly varying and can from one day to the next dramatically increase, or decrease. Markets include refugee SAR in the Mediterranean, refugee population estimates for aid dispersal, and post-natural disaster damage assessment. This market is unpredictable due to the natural forces at play (volcanoes, earthquakes), but vital to save thousands of lives every single year.





Customer: Who is your target customer? (max 500 characters)

Our target customers will be primarily non-governmental organizations including the International Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and Save the Children with the addition of the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).

We are a team of five undergraduate engineering students at NC State. Like millions of people across the United States and the world, three of the five members wear color cosmetics daily and are frustrated by the technological simplicity, high cost per use, and excessive waste of product and packaging. We have all spent the last four years refining our engineering mindsets and are eager to bring our problem-solving experience to the cosmetics industry. Part of what makes us well-suited to tackle this problem is our vigor and enthusiasm. We realize that this solution could come to fruition within our own lifetimes, and with the help of the eGames, perhaps even in the next few years.

Matthew Jackson, a Senior Mechanical Design Engineer who works at Plexus, is our startup mentor. Matthew has continually provided advice and direction in the development of our product over the past several months. From a list of potential product ideas, to the prototyping stage, his experience has lead our team to great success. Aside from Matthew, the team has reached out to various resources and has received training and support from the Engineering Entrepreneurs Program.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

There are four main problems with the current design of the mascara applicator. Soon after opening the mascara tube and exposing the fluid to air, it begins to dry out. When mascara starts to dry out, it gets clumpy and cannot be applied evenly to lashes. Second, there is no way to control how much mascara is on the brush at a time. This makes it extremely difficult to apply the desired amount to the eyelashes; the application process, in turn, can be very time consuming and frustrating. Third, the mascara fluid reservoir becomes a breeding ground for bacteria because there is no way to clean the brush without wasting a lot of mascara. Finally, many women spend copious amounts of money on multiple types of mascara since you need to use a different brush for each type. The mascara available on the market today is outdated. The multitude of issues with the current design leaves entrepreneurs, such as ourselves, a great opportunity to make breakthroughs in the makeup industry.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Our product is an innovative mascara wand that incorporates replaceable cartridges. These cartridges will be airtight to prevent the mascara fluid from drying out, giving the users the ability to eliminate waste and save money. Our design will minimize the risk of eye infection by allowing for easy cleaning of the brush, which will reduce bacterial growth. Reducing bacterial growth not only decreases the risk of infection, but it also allows the user to keep their mascara longer than the current recommendation of three months. Our product will include a plunger mechanism to allow for precise control of the amount of mascara fluid on the surface of the brush, shortening the time required for application and giving the user the look they desire. Overall, our product is superior to other products due to its advanced design. As a result, it solves more consumer complaints than any other product available.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

For the art and music industry, there are hundreds of new talents with the potential to pave their own path but lack the resources and ability to maximize their outreach. The main issue lies in the lack of resources. With big production studios charging thousands of dollars an hour to use their equipment, beginning artists must find their own ways to produce content. Just buying proper instruments can use up all of the funds available to acts, leaving them with no way to create marketable content. This issue is only made worse through the lack of outreach available to these artists. While almost everyone has a smartphone with HD video capabilities, the market is flooded with content so it is extremely important that bands have a professional eye and ear attached to their content creation to make it stand out.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Our solution to this issue is by taking the equally problematic parts and solving both of them at once. By joining the efforts of Crimson Moon Records and 2J Films, we have the ability to look at all sides of the issue and tackle them accordingly. Crimson Moon Records provides professional recording equipment while 2J Moving Pictures provides professional quality video equipment. We provide the service for free so any one who can get to the studio is able to perform a session. Many of the bands had not had the opportunity for a live video before the launch and are using it to apply for the large festivals that require live recording as part of the application.

Market: What is your venture's market? How big is it? Is the market growing? (max 500 characters)

Our market is primarily professional bands, which is very large. Our focus is current local bands but we are expanding to a wider geographical area.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

In 2000, 300 marathons took place around the globe; that number has grown more than 400% with 1,100 marathons now hosted every year in the U.S. alone. Now endurance races like marathons, triathlons, and Spartan races are the most popular recreational sporting events in the world. As more and more “weekend warriors” participate in these sporting events, the competition becomes increasingly fierce. Many athletes look for any advantage they can find. Ultra-competitive athletes have even begun to use continuous glucose monitors (CGM), ketone testing, saliva analysis, and sweat analysis kits to ensure they remain at peak performance for the entirety of the race. This technology is beginning to trickle down to the lower tiers of competitors as more information is becoming available about the dangers of low or very high blood sugar and electrolyte levels during endurance racing.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Thrive Biotechnologies will create a non-invasive, continuous, blood glucose monitor to all diabetics and endurance athletes the ability to monitor their blood sugar free of annoying and time consuming finger pricks. The non-invasive and continuous features of our proposed glucose monitor will drive usage among diabetics, pre-diabetics, and athletes. The device will remove the need for finger pricking or subcutaneous chip methods currently used to monitor blood sugar by diabetics and some highly competitive athletes. Tracking blood sugar will help prevent future illness and promote a healthier lifestyle among Thrive users. The device will allow also athletes to maintain energy levels and maximize performance through blood sugar tracking.

One other manufacturer of a “NVG Recorder” exists. It uses an old-stock, expensive lens from a failed product that retailed for $5000. Their lens assembly costs $315 alone and does not acquire the entire image that the user sees. Their commercial product retails for $410, the TOP NVG Recording Adapter retails for $250. The TOP device is superior and costs less.

Sales will be direct to consumer or direct to agency in the event of government purchasers. Up to this point, all production runs have been designed to be self sustaining, paying for each phase as the product has grown. Upon movement to larger scale injection molding, profit margins will open up that enable more funds for employee positions in marketing and order fulfillment.

The next step is going to injection molding for the Recording Adapter. Right now, a Raleigh-based prototyper is resin-casting the body as a stand-in for injection molding. Prize-winnings would help to safely invest in injection molding instead of risking the $20,000 that it would otherwise require. The eGarage is looking into purchasing an injection-molding machine, so the money required for injection molding may be reduced. However, quality molds still require some amount of investment.

TracKiD is comprised of Paul Keefer (CEO), Brandon Kashani (CFO), Sarah Novitt (COO), and Praneet Mocherla (CTO). Even though this is the first startup experience for everyone on the team, we believe that our team is best suited to tackle any kind of problem. This is mainly because we have the point of view from different genders, along with a veteran, a professional skydiver, a former nanny, and a student athlete. Given that the the team is comprised of equal numbers of chemical and electrical/computer engineers, we believe that we have more than enough technical expertise and ambition to quickly reunite lost children with their families at amusement parks.





Mentors/Advisors: Do you have any mentors or advisors currently assisting with your company? In what areas are you currently receiving mentorship or advice? (max 500 characters)

As students in the Engineering Entrepreneurial Program (EEP), we have two mentors from the Plexus Corporation. The mentors provide value experience and guidance in developing a product from conception to production. Furthermore, our team lacks material science and mechanical engineering expertise. As the product matures and more features are added, support in these areas would be available from the Plexus mentors if needed.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

There are approximately 400 theme parks around the country. Major theme parks experience a missing child around a dozen times a day. Often, this is simply a case of children wandering off, but the ordeal usually lasts about thirty minutes. A half an hour of frantically searching for your child can ruin what was supposed to be a fun day. Currently, there are no good solutions available to parents besides combing the park with security, giving the kid an expensive smartphone, or giving the kid a tracker such as Tile that does not work well over long distances.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

In light of this issue plaguing parents, our team has developed TrackID. We would like to offer a wearable tracking device that would allow parents to find their children within the confines of a theme park at the push of a button. Rather than the currently best solution of combing the park with security, parents will be able to track the exact location of their child with the use of our wearable tracker and smartphone app.

Approximately forty percent of americans visit theme parks each year with the target demographic being family with young children.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Trashr solves two problems. 
The first problem is the resource inefficiency found in the waste collection industry. Waste collection trucks average 2.5mpg and each truck burns 14,000 gallons of diesel per year. Fuel costs alone account for 20% of a waste management company’s budget. With the price of diesel fuel up 19% across the US in the last year, waste collection services are threatened. 

The second problem is that institutions struggle to benefit from green initiatives. Without guidelines, benchmarks, or data, building a green initiative like composting can easily end up being a financial burden. Even if a green initiative is cost effective, it may never be profitable, due to maintenance costs. Without data or guidelines, sustainable efforts are not justifiable, and often end up being discarded.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Trashr solves both problems with the same Trashr sensor network.

For problem one, The inefficiency of waste collection services, Trashr developed its Eco-Route software. Eco-Route is a truck routing algorithm which reduces fuel and labor costs. Trashr’s cellular sensor network determines how full dumpsters are and Eco-Route creates a truck schedule which never visits a dumpster too early. Research and tests indicate that Eco-Route reduces resource use by up to 35%. This means an institution could save $15,000 or 5000 gallons per truck. 

For problem two, the lack of proper data in sustainability, Trashr offers its Sustain + Gain platform. Trashr provides templates, benchmarks, and sensors for building quality green initiatives, like composting. By adding a Trashr sensor to the project, Trashr can validate, through the collected data, metrics like dollars saved and emissions reduced because of the effort, while reducing maintenance by up to 50%.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Plastic waste is an epidemic that continues to plague our land and seas. 6.3 of the 8.3 billion metric tons of the plastic produced globally becomes waste. Plastic waste has the largest effect on our climate and the many species that share this Earth. Today, efforts are geared at cleaning up existing waste, but at the rate that waste accumulates it is a losing battle. In order to combat this problem, solutions need to be geared towards prevention. Scientist have developed plastic alternatives that are made from plant material to address this problem. But even with this environmentally conscious alternative, bioplastics hold only 2% of the entire plastic industry. Businesses are very aware of just how wasteful the plastic industry is but refuse to make changes to their infrastructures without pressure. We are missing the presence of a powerhouse brand that utilizes bioplastics who can bring the technology to light, influence consumer demand, and thus drive change within the industry.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

With the technological strides made in bioplastics, the cost to produce it has become very competitive to oil based plastics. Our solution is to build a brand that embodies what we believe in and motivates consumers and businesses to make the plastic waste epidemic one of the past. We chose to infiltrate one of the most wasteful industries to attack the problem head on. We have designed a 100% biodegradable phone case that encapsulates the beauty of sustainability. It is made from bioplastics, eco-suede, and highlighted with elegantly grained coconut palm wood. Customers will have the option to donate $5 to a partnered sustainable charity of their choice for a hand carved engraving of their initials on the wood. We believe that the path to a sustainable future is through the connection of the consumer, the business, and the charities, which is why we will match every $5 donation. Our hopes are that the solution will inevitably come from our competitive pressure on the plastic industry.

Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

With the technological strides made in bioplastics, the cost to produce it has become very competitive to oil based plastics. Our solution is to build a brand that embodies what we believe in and motivates consumers and businesses to make the plastic waste epidemic one of the past. We chose to infiltrate one of the most wasteful industries to attack the problem head on. We have designed a 100% biodegradable phone case that encapsulates the beauty of sustainability. It is made from bioplastics, eco-suede, and highlighted with elegantly grained coconut palm wood. Customers will have the option to donate $5 to a partnered sustainable charity of their choice for a hand carved engraving of their initials on the wood. We believe that the path to a sustainable future is through the connection of the consumer, the business, and the charities, which is why we will match every $5 donation. Our hopes are that the solution will inevitably come from our competitive pressure on the plastic industry.

We see potential opportunity to receive a utility patent with the assembly of our dual layer case. The inner core will be a hard bioplastic that is over-moulded by a soft leather-like bioplastic as an outer core. We also have a one of the kind latching mechanism for our case that we believe can be protected. Due to constraints on funding we have not yet filed for any patents, trademarks, or licenses, but will do so closer to production time. - How would you rate the venture's consideration of intellectual property?","Market and Customer



Market: What is your venture's market? How big is it? Is the market growing? (max 500 characters)

We are targeting the phone case and accessory market which is valued at over $62 billion dollars and growing. As access to mobile phones across the globe increases so does the demand for phone cases and accessories. This is one of the biggest global plastic markets in the world, and even with its size an opportunity to achieve success is very realizable for products with the ability to differentiate and stand out.





Customer: Who is your target customer? (max 500 characters)

Our target customers are environmentally conscious consumers initially to espouse the sustainable alternative we offer. Our goal is to great zealots within this customer base that will spread our mission through word of mouth to the many other phone case users. Our product is not intended to be a product for everyone, it’s main function is to serve as a vehicle to paint our vision of a plastic-less world.





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

We have done some ground level customer discovery on the idea of a plasticless phone case and received great feedback. We found that out of the 100 people we surveyed 92% would choose the plastic alternative if faced with a choice between the two. In conjunction with our plasticless concept, our design received high praise on its solidarity. Through this, we learned how to position ourselves. When we complete final prototypes we will drive traffic to a landing page to gain more diverse feedback.

Our largest competition is Otterbox and Apple made phone cases as they hold the largest market share by many strides. However, we have a competitive advantage in design and social and environmental impact. Our brand empowers charities and produces a wasteless product. Indirectly we are competing with the overflow of phone cases that exist in the saturated market. Although the market is spread thin, we see an opportunity due to the lack of brand presences within the industry.

As urban environments become more choked with automotive traffic, cycling is becoming the most efficient manner of transportation, not to mention the well-known benefits to health and well being. Yet the infrastructure in many cities has failed to keep up with the needs of current and would-be cyclists. These needs are simple: to navigate traffic without undue risk of injury, to feel welcome and visible on the streets rather than ignored, and to store their property at a destination without imminent theft. Personal safety and property security are two problems facing commuting cyclists in urban and other settings, that are not well addressed by current cycling accessories available on the market. Current lighting attachments are not bright enough and do not provide a method of communication with motorists, and many cycling accessories do not prevent theft of itself when not in use.

The Tuéri Light Lock product sets to solve multiple problems and inefficiencies for avid commuting cyclists by providing multiple desired features and functionality within one aesthetic design that also protects itself from theft. Our solution provides larger and brighter light signals than many, if not all commercial options available, provides convenient turn signals, an incoming rear hazard detection system completed with a radar sensor and motion-activated camera, sound alerts, and a robust locking interface to protect all of these components and the bicycle from theft when not in use.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Plant pathogens (bacterial, fungal, or viral) decrease overall crop yield globally on average 15-30%. In some locations such as Brazil, plant pathogens force farmers to spray pesticides on soybeans every 3 weeks for the entire growing season or risk losing the entirety of their crop. Farmers are primarily affected by plant pathogens and in the US alone, the crop protection network states that plant pathogens caused over $6 billion dollars in economic losses in the corn and soybean market in 2017. To combat pathogens, companies and farmers introduce resistance genes into their seed stocks. However, these resistance genes are effective against only 1 specific pathogen. Additionally, pathogens develop mechanism to overcome those resistance genes on average in 3-5 years. Alternatively, farmers can spray chemicals on their fields. Similar to resistance genes, chemicals can lose their effectiveness against pathogens.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Upstream Biotechnology wants to solve the problem of yield loss due to pathogens by introducing patented regulatory cassette that confers broad spectrum resistance to all bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. Our venture can solve the problem of pesticide use and yield loss because of our ability to regulate the master regulator of immune responses in plants. Before our regulatory technology, companies tried to regulate the master immune regulator with detrimental results. Plants have limited resources and researchers have shown that plants can either defend themselves, or grow. Farmers can help plants defense themselves against pathogens by spraying pesticides. With the introduction of our regulatory cassettes, Upstream Biotechnology can accomplish two main goals. We can save farmers time and money by eliminating the need for pesticide applications and increase crop yields since plants will no longer need to decide whether to defend themselves or grow and produce more food.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

uRankU is solving the college search problem. Each year, nearly 3.1 million students graduate high school and enroll in college. Finding the right college is especially challenging due to the large number of options available. In the United States alone, there are over 4,000 higher education institutions. However, each student is different, and there is no one-size-fits all approach to selecting the right college. Choosing the wrong college and being forced to transfer can cost a student tens of thousands of dollars.

Additionally, managing the application process is a difficult task. It can be hard to keep track of each of the deadlines for several schools, on top of a high school courseload, standardized tests, and other responsibilities.

Currently, the problem is being addressed in several places. For example, CollegeBoard offers an advanced search form on their website. Various web outlets also have rankings and search functions, however there is no comprehensive solution.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

uRankU solves this problem by presenting the necessary information in an easy-to-digest manner that simplifies the college search process.

When a student begins their college search, they create an account with uRankU and complete their profile. In doing so, they select the criteria that are important to them when selecting a college, and choose any schools they know they are already interested in.

uRankU will then analyze this data, and suggest additional schools based upon their fit to the student's personal criteria, as well as those schools that are similar to the ones they have already indicated interest in. This is the unique aspect of uRankU compared to other college search engines, the schools are matched to the student based upon a wide-variety of preferences, rather than simple metrics such as US News & World report rank, cost of attendance, and distance from home, to name a few.

In America, we make 411 billion trips every year1, with 87 percent of those trips2 taken in a personal vehicle. The average American spends about 17 hours every year finding a spot to park2 that vehicle, and with sprawling urban growth and a rapidly growing population, we can only expect to see that number increase in the years to come. As a car owner in a college town with an energetic nightlife, active event schedule, and congested campus, I have first hand experience with the struggles of finding a parking spot on a daily basis. With that said, if technology existed that could identify individual open parking spaces in real time, it would help the community as a whole utilize the power of modern technology to improve the efficiency of their day-to-day activities. The most similar competition we have found only provides estimates on best parking spaces, not live data for each spot.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

Our vision is a single comprehensive parking spot marketplace. Using beacon technology and an intuitive mobile app, users can find open spots in real time, and pay for that parking without leaving their vehicle. VADE will provide a single source for street, lot, and residential spots sourced from governments, institutions, commercial establishments, as well as a peer-to-peer network where users can list private spots to earn money. By connecting the individual beacons to centralized hubs and a single server, VADE can provide clients with real time and historical parking data and analytics to help them make more informed business decisions. Not only will clients know exactly what spots are open, occupied, or taken illegally, but they will also gain better insight into user habits that determine their pricing strategies. No company has been able to provide analytics for individual parking spaces that span city and peer to peer markets.

Our service and product will provide them with the data they need to get a parking space on time and as close as possible to where they are going. We are also appealing to cities and governments by providing them with data to see where and when people are parking so they can maximize profit. Also to towing companies as they will receive live data on illegally parked cars.





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

We have spoken to over 3000 people since December. Generally discussing the idea to hear their thoughts. At least 92% believed they would use the product at some point throughout their year. Since it is hard to get an honest opinion from friends, we talked to plenty of business owners, particularly in product development, and they all have commended the idea and are actively trying to be a part of it, having experienced individuals confirm our idea helped us recognize how great our market is.





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

We have found competition in the live data parking market but each one falls short for multiple reasons. Most of them can give you a good estimate about which parking deck to go to, some even know exactly which parking spot is open in a parking deck, but no company has tapped into the peer-to-peer side of the market or has the capability to provide data on exactly which spot is currently open on streets. We will combine all their tapped and untapped market into one place.

Revenue Model: What is the venture’s revenue model? How do you plan to sustain and grow your venture? (max 500 characters)

We have come to the conclusion that each sensor will cost less than 5 dollars a piece, which will be payed off with the first $5 we receive from transaction fees in each parking space, the rest will be profit from each sensor. We also plan on using the revenue from towing companies who pay to use our data, to further develop the app and maintain/improve our beacon sensors. We want to give the users the best experience possible while keeping cost low and only providing necessary functions.





Prize Winnings: How would eGames prize winnings help your venture? What are your current funding needs? (max 500 characters)

We will use the money for manufacturing the sensors. We need to have a consultation with an electrical engineering firm to increase our circuits efficiency. We also need the materials to build our first round of beta-beacons so that we can put them through relentless testing and find their flaws. This will be achieved with a plastic molding firm that can create the housing for our sensor, while Christian will make the circuits in house. After that, we will contact our connected manufactures.





Additional Info: Do you have needs outside of funding? Mentorship, physical space, advisors, etc. (max 500 characters)

We have an office space that Ritwik uses up in Chapel Hill, and we have plenty of advisors to help us along in finding the right companies for manufacturing and hardware development. We are very self contained and have all the necessary connections to take each step once we can afford it.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Over the past ten years, there has been a steady increase in the amount of patients visiting the emergency room (ER) resulting in crowding and slow treatment times. The inability to quickly monitor and locate patients in the emergency room can lead to patient health deterioration, high rates of patients leaving without receiving medical attention, and even death. In 2009, patients admitted to hospitals waited on average six hours in the emergency room, and nearly 400,000 waited 24 hours or more. Longer wait times to see a physician, because of overcrowding, have also been linked to relative increased mortality, hospital readmission, and higher patient left without being seen (LWBS) rates. Currently, patients wait for treatment in the ER without any sort of continuous monitoring device. Although wearable vital sign monitors would assist with monitoring patients, this technology is currently not being utilized in the emergency department.





Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

The Vital Guide is a vital sign monitoring system that consists of a patient-worn vital sign monitor, a patient health monitoring dashboard, and a charging station. The wearable device monitors patient heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation in real time. The dashboard displays real-time patient data from the wearable device to the ER nurse who can monitor patients in the waiting room. The wearable device also has the ability to track patients throughout the hospital by using indoor positioning system technology. The indoor positioning system will be provided by wireless nodes put in known locations throughout the hospital. The dashboard shows the physical location of patients on a map and their vital signs. By combining patient vital sign monitoring via the wearable vital sign monitor and determining patient location within the hospital, we are giving the health care provider visibility into waiting room patient health that is currently not available.

Our target customers are the very high, high, and medium volume hospitals. There are currently 681 very high volume, 599 high volume, and 962 medium volume hospitals in the United States. 





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

Our team has spoken to over two dozen medical providers, including medical doctors, emergency room managers, nurses, clinicians, EMT’s, and hospital administration. We received feedback that real-time monitoring along with patient location would be desirable and help improve hospital logistics and patient health outcomes. Our customers desire a noninvasive device that could integrate with existing hospital electronic medical records.





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

The main competition is Welch Allyn, who produces vital sign monitors which are used in the triage room and the waiting room. However, these monitors are not continuous, cost around $1180 a unit, and cannot monitor every patient in the emergency department. The other competitors in this space such as the BioStamp and the Vital Connect are not currently sold on the market. Our competitive advantage is that we can monitor patient location alongside patient vital signs.

The team is seeking to enter the vital sign measuring market, valued at $4.1 billion with a 6.5% compound annual growth rate. This market includes products such as Fitbit and blood sugar monitors. The market is segmented into different industry targets which include hospital and physician segments, emergency medicine, and personal use segments. We are targeting the hospital segment of the market.





Customer: Who is your target customer? (max 500 characters)

The US Agency for Health Research and Quality classifies ER visit volume into 4 categories: Very High (60,000+ annual patients), High (40,000 – 59,999 annual patients), Medium (20,000 – 39,999 annual patients), and Low (19,999 or fewer annual patients). Our target customers are the very high, high, and medium volume hospitals. There are currently 681 very high volume, 599 high volume, and 962 medium volume hospitals in the United States. 





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

Our team has spoken to over two dozen medical providers, including medical doctors, emergency room managers, nurses, clinicians, EMT’s, and hospital administration. We received feedback that real-time monitoring along with patient location would be desirable and help improve hospital logistics and patient health outcomes. Our customers desire a noninvasive device that could integrate with existing hospital electronic medical records.





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

The main competition is Welch Allyn, who produces vital sign monitors which are used in the triage room and the waiting room. However, these monitors are not continuous, cost around $1180 a unit, and cannot monitor every patient in the emergency department. The other competitors in this space such as the BioStamp and the Vital Connect are not currently sold on the market. Our competitive advantage is that we can monitor patient location alongside patient vital signs.

Revenue Model: What is the venture’s revenue model? How do you plan to sustain and grow your venture? (max 500 characters)

The revenue model of the Vital Guide system will be through sales of the physical hardware assets to hospitals and through yearly software licenses. Revenue will be sustained by selling the disposable wristbands for the wearable module. Our devices are smaller and can be mass manufactured; therefore, hospitals can purchase more of our devices at an inexpensive rate. We can further expand our market by expanding into international hospitals and disaster management units.





Prize Winnings: How would eGames prize winnings help your venture? What are your current funding needs? (max 500 characters)

The eGames prize winnings would help to continue prototyping the system and decrease the size of the wearable wristband. As well, it would help to create a fully functional electrical PCB and prototype according to the size of weight of the design. Our current funding needs are to continue research development of the system and preliminary patent legal fees.





Additional Info: Do you have needs outside of funding? Mentorship, physical space, advisors, etc. (max 500 characters)

Our needs outside of funding are a board of advisors that are tied to the medical device industry. As well, we have need of a mentor that experience of going through the FDA medical device approval process.

Wiskar is pushing the bounds of current technology and expectations by allowing anyone with a phone and a web connection (not even an app required) the freedom to experience the magic of the virtual world.

My solution is providing an access point for everyday people to enjoy AR on their phone by simply opening up a website on their browser.

Market: What is your venture's market? How big is it? Is the market growing? (max 500 characters)

I want to start marketing Wiskar in the consumer market. I have developed an e-commerce website selling AR capable coffee mugs that let you watch Gifs. The use case here is gimmicky and fun, however I believe it is a gateway to get AR tech into the hands of consumers. AR is a rapidly growing field, and I think Wiskar is hitting the market at a great time to attract growing consumer interest. Long term, I want to build AR virtual interfaces combined with internet of things to control the world.





Customer: Who is your target customer? (max 500 characters)

My target customer for the AR coffee mug is coffee drinkers who enjoy Gifs. This is a large market, but I plan specifically to target software developer communities. I feel the disposable income, interest in emerging tech would make them ideal early adopters for this product.

I pitched the AR Coasters idea to a local bar owner, and was told that he would pay up to $100 a month for me to provide this AR service.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Employees
80% of US workers receive little to no physical activity during the workday and 78% of them experience stress on the job. 7 out of 10 deaths in the United States are due to preventable, lifestyle diseases. In 2015, nearly half of US adults had at least one chronic condition (Center for Disease Control). The bottom line is that Americans are getting sicker every year. 

Corporations
In America’s healthcare system, only $.05 of every $1 is invested in preventative health. 
As a result, companies lost $1.8Trillion dollars in 2015 due to poor employee health (US Department of Labor). Health conditions such as stress ($300 billion), chronic pain ($12.7billion), diabetes ($245 billion) and obesity ($153 million) negatively impact employees and companies.

Current Ways Problem is Being Addressed
Offline resources include onsite gyms/wellness centers and onsite providers.
Online resources include insurance company websites and on-demand fitness instruction.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

Employees
80% of US workers receive little to no physical activity during the workday and 78% of them experience stress on the job. 7 out of 10 deaths in the United States are due to preventable, lifestyle diseases. In 2015, nearly half of US adults had at least one chronic condition (Center for Disease Control). The bottom line is that Americans are getting sicker every year. 

Corporations
In America’s healthcare system, only $.05 of every $1 is invested in preventative health. 
As a result, companies lost $1.8Trillion dollars in 2015 due to poor employee health (US Department of Labor). Health conditions such as stress ($300 billion), chronic pain ($12.7billion), diabetes ($245 billion) and obesity ($153 million) negatively impact employees and companies.

Current Ways Problem is Being Addressed
Offline resources include onsite gyms/wellness centers and onsite providers.

Our revenues will be based on the subscription fees that we will ask artist to pay. 
For the moment, we fixed our subscription at 5€ per month per artist. An artist account can therefore be composed by several musicians.
Some features will be free of charges like the ability to manage their online musical resume.

The other source of revenue will be from our advertisement spaces:
- via bars or artists willing to be promoted on our public apps
- via AdSense ads on our mobile and wep app.

After spending love money in the project, we now need to invest in our beta-version product as well as startup expense in advertisements to get more users and to reach our first paid customers. 
Thanks to this next investment, we will be able to be scalable as we will have incomes, reinvested in advertisement and in new amazing features for our beloved users.





Additional Info: Do you have needs outside of funding? Mentorship, physical space, advisors, etc. (max 500 characters)

If a financial help could be a significant support for our development and for our customer acquisition, we would be pleased to enter an incubator such as HQ Raleigh.

Handbags embody social and personal meaning. They are closely connected to their owner, intensely private, and, deeply expressive of a woman’s life. These precious items conceal and protect our most intimate possessions, thus, functionality and durability is key, along with uniqueness and style. Very few handbag companies allow for customization of their bags or produce limited editions of their merchandise, and those that do charge several thousands of dollars.

The global luxury goods industry is the second most valuable luxury market, only behind luxury cars. The retail value of women’s handbags in the U.S. was $10.51 billion in 2016 (www.statista.com). However, this market did not continue to grow in 2017, unfortunately it dropped a little and it is due to the changing demands of consumers. Millennials crave sartorial individuality and their spending habits reflect that. Competing with Amazon is also a challenge for handbag companies.





Customer: Who is your target customer? (max 500 characters)

The target customers are active, strong, independent women willing to express their creativity. These women are on the go so they need a functional bag of high quality, but also, a bag that represents them. Handbags say a lot about a person and these women know the value of having a unique, beautiful bag. They appreciate the craftsmanship and attention to detail. Supporting local businesses is also a plus in their minds and they love standing out from their peers. 





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

A survey of 48 individuals revealed that people are willing to spend more on handmade, customizable handbags. The top attributes people look at when deciding to buy a bag are size, shape, color, functionality and durability. This survey also showed that most people own around 5 handbags.

Personal interviews revealed that different women prioritize different things depending on their day to day life. This is why allowing for customization is key.

Holly Aiken - locally made handbags with some personalization possibilities is a direct competitor. However, her synthetic materials (vinyl and polyester), bright pastel colors and simple motifs speak to a very different customer than Wyker designs.
Sandast - another direct competitor produces handmade leather bags in LA. These bags are beautiful but their boxy aesthetic is masculine.

Most other handmade leather goods are simple in their construction lacking linings and unique details.

These women are on the go so they need a functional bag of high quality, but also, a bag that represents them. Handbags say a lot about a person and these women know the value of having a unique, beautiful bag. They appreciate the craftsmanship and attention to detail. Supporting local businesses is also a plus in their minds and they love standing out from their peers. 





Customer Discovery: What customer discovery has your venture conducted? How many potential customers have you interviewed/surveyed? Did you learn anything new through your customer discovery process? (max 500 characters)

A survey of 48 individuals revealed that people are willing to spend more on handmade, customizable handbags. The top attributes people look at when deciding to buy a bag are size, shape, color, functionality and durability. This survey also showed that most people own around 5 handbags.

Personal interviews revealed that different women prioritize different things depending on their day to day life. This is why allowing for customization is key. 





Competition: Who is your venture’s competition (indirect or direct)? What is your competitive advantage? (max 500 characters)

Holly Aiken - locally made handbags with some personalization possibilities is a direct competitor. However, her synthetic materials (vinyl and polyester), bright pastel colors and simple motifs speak to a very different customer than Wyker designs.
Sandast - another direct competitor produces handmade leather bags in LA. These bags are beautiful but their boxy aesthetic is masculine.

Most other handmade leather goods are simple in their construction lacking linings and unique details.

The global luxury goods industry is the second most valuable luxury market, only behind luxury cars. The retail value of women’s handbags in the U.S. was $10.51 billion in 2016 (www.statista.com). However, this market did not continue to grow in 2017, unfortunately it dropped a little and it is due to the changing demands of consumers. Millennials crave sartorial individuality and their spending habits reflect that. Competing with Amazon is also a challenge for handbag companies.

Problem: What problem is your venture trying to solve? Include the following: who is affected, size of the problem and current ways the problem is being addressed. (max 1,000 characters)

People often have to dress for two different temperature environments every day, causing the inconvenience of carrying around jackets and sweatshirts when they become too hot. We first noticed the problem in August where the sweltering heat is unbearable outdoors, but the indoor AC makes you shiver. Upon further research we found that Americans experience an average temperature fluctuation of 20 °F during the day. The Southwest region of the United States (U.S.) experiences the largest temperature swings with averages near 30 °F. Due to this wide range in temperature, people across the U.S. have to change clothing or wear several layers during the day.

Men’s and women's apparel in the U.S. has a combined market revenue of over $51.6 billion dollars. With the wearable technology market growing past $5.8 billion in the U.S., we want to change the paradigm of comfort clothing and make smart textiles available to the everyday user.



Solution: How is your venture solving this problem? What is unique to your company that allows you to solve this problem? (max 1,000 characters)

We are engineering a shape memory polymer and integrating it into a textile. The polymer has special properties that allow pores in the fabric to open when the ambient temperature is hot and close when it is cold, allowing for a temperature adjusting fabric. We are creating a T-shirt with our special fabric implemented at key areas of the body that release the largest amounts of heat: underarms and upper back. The shirt is meant for everyday wear. It provides a cheap and easy solution to dressing for two temperatures. Currently, no other company in our target sector implements shape memory polymers to combat temperature.

Pick one to start and show the other(s) as ""future"" additional markets. that lets you be more focused and raises your odds of initial success while showing potential investors that you are thinking already of future , added markets. Decide which one to do first based on how EASY it will be to get some success AND market feedback, NOT the size of the potential market which can be seducing. 

Lastly, you need tto consider whether you are COMPETING with PTs or providing them with an alternative solution that what they are using today. Once you decide that, you can create a Go-To_Market that either includes PTs or excludes them and works around them, e.g. selling directly to Insurance companies or Drugstores as a non-PT provided solution.

A few things that stood out to me... I like the idea to take a commission as your earned income stream. I wondered how you came up with 10%? What percent of revenue do you expect to be earned income versus contributions? Given that fund raising can be unpredictable, having a robust earned income strategy would be advisable. What other sources of earned income have you considered? 
I also thought your point about the importance of relationships was right on. Great move taking an internship at The Carrack - there is not better way to learn about the community than to be right in the middle of it. I also thought your strategy to target college artists was a smart pipeline strategy. I made me wonder what your strategy is to reach the freelancers already out in the world. You mentioned the Office of Raleigh Arts as a ""rival,"" but they could be a powerful ally. 
I also have a few questions that you will hopefully find helpful to think about...Where should these spaces be located? Do you have specific neighborhoods in mind in Raleigh? Your users talked about feeling ""isolated"" - what is the price of isolation? In other words, if they were to pay a monthly fee, what would they pay? Is 10% commission a price that they would pay?

The textbook industry seems ripe for disruption and cost pressure is significant. Your idea raised a number of general questions for me. What percent of textbook products are now digital and are they cheaper than hard copy? Do you think Librobee is a short-term venture or do you see hard copy textbooks sticking around for decades to come? What has been the rate of ebook adoption by customers? Why do students prefer or not prefer ebooks? For those that still pay for hard copy, what motivates them to buy instead of borrow? It seems that your assumption is that most (or enough to sustain your business) students still prefer a hard copy book, don't need to write in it (and thus can re-sell), and that these preferences will be stable in the face of other digital options.

You said those sites are a ""hassle"" - what makes your user experience easier/better? Based on what you provided here, I do not have a clear sense of what the software actually does. Second, what operational support will you need to run this company? You mention that students will drop off and pick up and that books will be stored. Do you have an operational plan for how to efficiently do this work? What book volume are you expecting? How would you staff what seems to be a seasonal effort? Again, a more clear sense of the experience would be helpful.

Thanks for this pitch. 

- It seems the big opportunity is helping big-box retailers engage -- in many different ways -- with their customers through some form of an app. Using the location service as a way to attract customers seems really smart, especially if the retailer can then engage the customer in other other ways. Does this mean you'd want to white-label your app and allow retailers to brand the app?

- If the above is the goal, you'd really want to make sure that this location service solves a real pain point for customers. Would customers find use in the location feature? Have you spoken to customers about this? Would they take the time to download the app? These are the biggest questions for me. It seems like a next good step is to do a bunch of customer discovery around these questions.

- Evaluating market size by the $$ size of the big-box retail market is less useful than the number of physical stores because you would likely be licensing on a per store basis, right? How many stores are big enough to fit the profile, and how much do you think you'd sell a license for? This will give you a sense for the overall revenue potential.

Thanks for this pitch. 

- I love that the two of you are putting yourselves out there and trying to create something of value. Kudos to you for throwing your hat in the ring.

- Great instinct to start by doing. The fact that you have a prototype, and you already have users of that prototype, sets you up to learn and iterate quickly. It's great to hear that users have given positive feedback. 

- One recommendation for a next step -- take those already satisfied users and see if you can get them to pay for this first iteration of your product. Test your assumptions about a subscription price. You may find that people like the product but not when there's a price tag attached, or you may find that you can charge much more than you initially thought. Regardless, you will learn a lot about the actual value of the product, and these learnings will help you decide whether or how to pivot. 

- It seems like there's a need for Homework Homie among your users based on the testing you've done, but as an outsider (and admittedly someone many years out of college) learning about this concept for the first time I'm not sure I fully understand the two solutions (homework tracker and contextual homework help) and what problem they are solving. More specifically, when you say students have ""difficulty tracking their homework"" what does that actually mean? Why do they have difficulty? And when you say students use online answers to finish hard homework problems, does that mean they don't know how to look in their professor's notes, or prefer not to? I could use a little more insight into whether the pain points are real enough to warrant a technology solution. Maybe you could put together a few user stories or case studies that highlight how real students have struggled to keep organized and complete assignments. 

Best of luck and keep at it!

- I would recommend spending a good amount of time testing features with actual users as you continue to develop the software. Instead of just asking them if they like the concept, put it in front of them and watch them use it. Interview them in real time. This will save you so much time, and will help you build something that your users truly love. 

- I come away with a lot of questions about the model. You will charge a monthly fee to users who want to keep notes private? What kind of notes? Why would a user need the software to store notes vs. storing notes elsewhere? If the real value is in the clarifying comments and summaries, why not charge for access to those features instead? How will IP holders get paid for use of their research? By view? A licensing fee? How much will that cost?

- Clear problem, clear pain point, clear solution.

- Seems like the model has already been tested and validated across 10 campuses. Nice!

- ""We don't pay for parts until we use them""... this is huge! Can you get away with this at scale?

- Your video doesn't ever really say what it is that you repair. One can make an inference, but if the video is the first exposure someone gets to RepairU, it may not be clear what it is you actually do. 

- I would describe the tone of the video as melancholy. If I didn't understand English, I would assume that something sad was happening. As you think about marketing to college students (through video or otherwise), think about how to appeal to them in a high-energy, maybe even quirky way. Are your technicians quirky people? To this point, maybe you can build your brand personality off of the personalities of your technicians. Make it personal. Make it about the people and the high-touch service. I imagine the way students will hear about RepairU is through word-of-mouth from people who actually know the student technician on campus. That technician's brand will be critical, so your ability to sell that brand will be important as well. I would start there as you think about your marketing plan.

- As you grow, and especially if you decide to highlight the expertise and personalities of your technicians, your biggest challenge will be finding and training the right technicians. Their brand will be become your brand, so finding the right fit, and preparing them for the work, will be really important. Have you thought about a formalized recruitment and training program that can be implemented at scale? What are the attributes that you look for in technicians? 

- I would have liked more detailed information on the revenue model. What's your average value per transaction? How much do you pay the technician? What's your margin per transaction? How will that scale?

- The one downside to this model is that it's very people intensive, and there isn't a lot of operating leverage. In other words, every sale comes with a high service cost (ie, paying the technician). What about the DIY kit as a stand alone product? Could this be another revenue channel that would allow you to reach an entirely different level of scale? I would suggest building the RepairU on-campus high-touch brand first, but the kit seems like a great longer-term option.

- How did you arrive at $37M? 92k x $200 = $18.4M... ?

- Is your target customer diabetics or high-performance athletes? This feels like an important decision that needs to be made because it will impact how you market, how you sell, whom you sell to, how you position and design the product, who your competitors are, etc. 

- Revenue model: in addition to selling Thrive, have you thought about adding a subscription service for access to enhanced reporting? In other words, can you turn one-time customers into subscription customers?

- One concern is that it seems like Nemaura and KWatch are playing in the same space and are a few development stages ahead of Thrive. If they've already got products that have been tested and are about to be released, we can probably expect that they've learned a lot and will continue to iterate on design, comfort, technology, etc. and will be able to do so more quickly. Are there other ways you can differentiate? Maybe something like targeting college athletic programs? Not sure if that's the right idea, but it may be worth spending some time thinking about how Thrive can separate itself from the field.

- Interesting idea (one that really taps into something that is very emotional for parents) with a really interesting revenue model. The concept of selling the device and also charging an app access fee is brilliant! 

- Is the idea that you would sell the device to the amusement park, and then they would ""rent"" it to the user for the day? This would seem to make the most sense, right? Unless parents think they'd get value out of the device in other settings?

- One thing to think about is the complexity of the transaction. If I'm the parent, I've got to rent the device from the park (one transaction), then I've got to buy access to the app (a second transaction).

This seems to be the value proposition for uRankU... that you can make better matches for students. The question is how, and even if the algorithm is more sophisticated, does that really lead to better matches? How will you know? Is your metric the % of uRankU users who end up transferring vs. the 35% transfer rate? Is it some other form of student satisfaction? I think it'll be important to really nail down this unique value proposition.

- I would suggest using any funding to do more customer discovery. You've got three customer bases (parkers, parking spot owners, and towing companies) but it seems you haven't yet tested your assumptions across all three segments. I would imagine a busy parking garage in midtown Manhattan may have close to a 0% vacancy rate. Why would they want to invest in a product like this? Do they have a pain point? If so, how well do you understand it?

- The revenue model is unclear, at least as you've presented it here. Who is the payer? Will you sell the app to the parker? Will you sell subscriptions to the parking space owners? Will you sell the beacons? And for all of these, what are your assumptions around price and volume? 

- Overall, you've got a great high-level problem with a great high-level proposed solution, but the details are fuzzy. Before spending too much more time on the technology, I'd recommend testing your customer assumptions and getting to more detail on your revenue model.

Although it can be a small flat cost to help cover costs, an interesting approach would be a ""pay what you can"" model that we're seeing introduced to restaurants everywhere.
- You're certainly providing your volunteers with valuable experience, but with some tweaks to the model, perhaps that experience can become a job as well.
- There's no mention of the quality of the coffee, but I can see it being extremely beneficial to partner with a socially conscious company like Counter Culture for reduced pricing and a coattail to ride. (I can make introductions into Counter Culture).

- The big question: how does the alcohol taste? Can it match the quality and drinking experience of barrel-aged alcohol? If you've been able to perform e.g. taste tests matching fast-aged alcohol with a traditional product and consumers genuinely can't tell the difference, then you've really got something.

- What kinds of contamination are detected? Flint is mentioned, so presumably lead can be detected by these sensors. What about other toxins, pathogens, etc?
- Why is the maintenance burden reduced? Is it solely due to the change in power source? What power sources do your competitors use?
- Will you invest significant time/money into the relevant software? Can sensor firmware be upgraded remotely?

As a lifelong 'enthusiast' artist and musician, I think this sounds like a great idea! 

Suggestions: 
1. Make sure you clarify what C.A.S.T.L.E. means in your written presentation. While you state it in the associated video, I was left wondering what the acronym stood for while initially reading your submission. 
2. Your video is very informative, but could be more visually appealing. You don't need anything too complicated or fancy. Simple graphics or representative photos/clips of the desired space would be very helpful. 

Overall a very good idea. This sounds like a place I would love to frequent. Once established I think this is a concept that could reach far outside of your original target location. Good luck!

This is a very interesting idea, and certainly one that addresses an important issue. 

Suggestions: 
1. I like the concept, and see the need, but I think your product descriptions need some refinement. I understand WHAT Evap does, but not HOW municipalities will use Evap to improve their infrastructure. 
2. Please be sure to polish your presentation. There are some unanswered or unfinished questions. Your video is very informative, but cuts off mid sentence at the end. Presentation value is very important!

As a lifelong musician, who has toured, recorded, and played hundreds of shows, an app/service like this sounds great! Something I wish I'd had access to years ago

A few suggestions: 

1. You mention you already have an app available, but do not show it in your video. It would be nice to see the app demonstrated. 
2. There are quite a few competitors, in this market. Bandmix.com, Reverbnation.com, soundcloud.com, nashvillegigfinder.com to name a few. You will have to ensure that you set yourself apart from them and offer unique services they cannot

This is a great idea, and definitely a market that is in want of a solution like Palmer. I personally have been in hundreds of business meetings... and almost never am able to effectively take notes. Having an assistant such as Palmer would be invaluable. 

A few suggestions: 

1. If you haven't, already, be sure to consider teleconferences and/or Skype/Zoom type calls. With many companies having several offices, and remote positions rapidly growing in popularity, these are quickly becoming the norm. It would be important to ensure that your voice recognition software could work in these situations, or, have some sort of interface that works with VOIP or online based conferencing systems like Skype, Zoom, GoToMeeting, etc

2. B2B will certainly be a major source of revenue, but don't forget to consider office supply distributors and retailers. Your margins will be lower, but volume should more than compensate. 

3. I recommend offering a tiered monthly subscription rate, based on company size or the quantity of meetings performed. At $1000/mo you are pricing yourself out of the market for smaller companies or those that would use the service on a more occasional basis

Overall, it's a great concept! I love the idea, and would buy one, today.

Great idea! As you detail in your submission, the US, and many other countries around the globe, have flawed and aging infrastructures for our drinking water. 

Just a couple of suggestions
1. Your video is great, and very informative. I would have liked, however, to see some product photos or diagrams, even if they're early phase. Just nice to put a 'face to the name' so to speak. 
2.  Nail down your pricing structure ASAP, and be sure to consider tiered subscription pricing based on quantity of units in use.

This is a great, if very ambitious, project. I can see the need for a system, like this, world-wide. Certainly valuable in larger scale disasters, but seems like it could be easily be scaled down to smaller users such as local Fire, PD, SAR, etc. 

A few suggestions
1. Since you are basing your idea on open source materials and software, competitors will be inevitable. You will need to find something that truly sets your product/company apart
2. Be sure to look outside of NGO's, as well. I suspect this concept could easily be contracted to gov't agencies. 
3. Get some mentors in place, ASAP! This sounds like a complex venture

A very interesting idea, but clearly an issue that needs to be addressed. You have presented the need and your solutions, very well. 

A few questions/suggestions
1. It's not entirely clear how your dumpster sensors work. Are they based on volume or weight? Where are they located? 
2. I recommend you spend a little more time explaining/promoting the Sustain + Gain portion of your business. 
3. Many waste management municipalities and private companies are converting from diesel to natural gas to power their trucks. It would be worthwhile to include figures from that, in your presentation

You're tackling a huge industry, and a huge problem! Congratulations. As you no doubt know, the phone case market is very full, but you've done a nice job of differentiating yourselves with a unique product. 

Suggestions: 
1. Tie up IP and patent issues ASAP. This market may be too small for the bigger brands to care about, right now, but that won't necessarily stop them from submitting patents
2. I know it's not your focus, but it may be important to address the cases strength and or any guarantees against phone breakage, especially since you list Otterbox as one of your key competitors. 
3. It would be worth noting *how* biodegradable your cases are. i.e. they will break down in 10 years vs. 10000 years for 'real' plastic. Also... as silly as it sounds, I'm sure someone will ask if it will 'biodegrade' while in use...
4. This is a little nit-picky, but I noticed several typos and grammatical errors in your submission. 

Overall a great cause and a very attractive product. Good luck! ",Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,"This is a well put together, professional, presentation! 

As an avid cyclist, and occasional commuter, I can say the need and market space for a product like this is certainly there. 

My only concern is that features like radar and integrated cameras will cause both your production and retail prices to be very high, especially at lower volumes. I would suggest adding a second model that is only a light/lock, but is able to be retrofitted with additional features should the consumer want. 

Otherwise, very well done! ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Good,Excellent,Good,Good,Good,Good,Good,Good,Excellent,Good,"Thank you for the submission

This is an ambitious project! I like the concept and your core plans but worry about the sheer size of the problem. 

A few suggestions
1. It's a little unclear how you will make money and/or consumers will pay for your service. Is the app subscription based? A one time download fee? 'Premier' memberships? What if non-app users park in a Vade spot? Will they be charged? 
2. I would like to hear more information about the sensors and your corresponding network. You mention low hardware costs ($5) for the sensors, but don't factor in wear/tear, replacement, placement, and other management. Will there be a single sensor for every parking spot? Or will each sensor cover multiple spots? 
3. As I mentioned earlier, this is a vast issue. I would like to see plasn and timeline of how you propose to scale up from start-up status, to regional, to national, and beyond. 

Overall, I think it's a great idea, and has enormous potential, but I would like to see some refinements to the infrastructure and logistics plans. The video looks great, and is very informative.

Coming from an agricultural background, many local NC farmers cannot afford to separate out their food for smaller programs like this and don't have the time to deliver it to a facility either. I don't think I have enough information here, (maybe this is not part of your business plan) but I would encourage you to not charge the farmers with the produce a fee. They are struggling enough as it is. If it is only the suppliers with the fees, how are you going to move the produce to your storage facility? Will they have to do it? Do they have the people available? If it isn't enough to fill a truck load will they use those resources? 

If you're moving produce there are also numerous laws and regulations around moving and delivering fresh produce. If the distributers agree to add all these drop off points into their routes thats great as their trucks would be up to code, but if people are supposed to be picking it up and then selling it at their restaurants, you're adding a lot of liability to the business. 

Overall I think you've got a good start with a great team! I'd really like to better understand how the food will be moved because this is a major part of your business and I feel like not enough information was given.

Additional work needs to be done in forming a team that could bring the product to market - in particular resources skilled in software development and GPS.  

I think a key consideration as this effort moves forward is keeping the user interface VERY simple.  If it isn't developed to accommodate even the most basic user, frustration or apprehension may keep the app/software from seeing optimal use.  

Finally, bear in mind that this software will also require the big-box retailers to train and motivate their staff to respond to the app in order to maintain a positive experience with the software as well as a good customer experience.

The manufacture of these products, ostensibly, pursues both of these goals.  However, the video stated a clear desire to focus away from the negatives that Haiti may have become known for (earthquakes, etc.) and instead focus on the island's natural beauty.  That is an excellent goal as the revenues from increased tourism in Haiti would address a multitude of issues facing the country.  However, I'm not entirely clear from the information shared on this venture how this product effectively communicates that message of Haiti's beauty and untapped tourist potential.

Also, as a women-owned business, you may qualify for other grants. 

Edge of Urge and Lumina are two local boutiques that could be great mentors. 

Likewise, Hollin Norwood is a graduate of the Design School and works for Ariat as the Director of Design. He's now in Durham and could provide helpful advice about working in the leather fashion industry. 

Your pitch needs a bit more information about Wyker Designs different from other bespoke handbags. 

If your bags incorporate repurposed pieces or are completely made-to-order (no stock and no waste), then you may highlight the sustainability aspect of your business. Fame & Partners is another women's fashion company that uses a similar business model.

The target market is not the amount of money spent at Theme Parks, it is the amount of money spent at theme parks on child safety! Vastly different. Also, I would reccomend staying away from theme parks as you limit yourself. ""massive need to keep tabs on children in crowded events"" there a lot more places than just theme parks. 

Try to find a differentiator and why they should adopt your product over anyone elses in the world!
